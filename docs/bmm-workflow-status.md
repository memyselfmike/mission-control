Next: Review and approve Story 5.2 (Create Task Entity) via story-ready workflow, then generate story-context and implement.
- **2025-10-22**: Story 5.2 (Create Task Entity - 5 pts) marked ready for development by SM agent. Story file status updated from Draft ‚Üí Ready. Story validated: 7 ACs clear and testable (entity creation, encapsulated behavior, validation, factory methods, immutability, domain logic, comprehensive tests), comprehensive implementation plan (8 tasks, 39 subtasks), testing strategy complete (25+ tests, 90%+ coverage target), architecture alignment verified (Hexagonal/Clean, OOP principles, uses value objects from Story 5.1). Next: Generate implementation context via story-context workflow, then DEV agent implements.
- **2025-10-25**: Story 5.2 (Create Task Entity - 5 pts) approved and marked Done by user (Mike). Implementation complete with 44 tests passing (100%), all 7 ACs met. Created Task entity with 18 fields, 9 behavior methods, 3 factory methods, enforced immutability and self-validation. Architecture compliance verified (Hexagonal/Clean, SOLID, zero infrastructure dependencies, Strangler Fig pattern). Sprint 5 progress: 8/10 pts (80% of Phase 1). Overall progress: 90/318-388 pts (23-28%). Next: Draft Story 5.3 (Repository Interfaces) via create-story workflow.
- **2025-10-25**: Story 5.3 (Create Repository Interfaces) marked ready for development by SM agent. Moved from Draft ‚Üí Ready. Story moved to IN PROGRESS. Next: Generate context via story-context workflow, then implement via dev-story.
- **2025-10-25**: Completed story-context for Story 5.3 (Create Repository Interfaces). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-5.3-repository-interfaces.xml. Assembled comprehensive implementation context with 7 acceptance criteria, 6 documentation references (CLAUDE.md, solution-architecture.md, epics.md, Stories 5.1 & 5.2), 7 code artifacts (Task entity, value objects, legacy memory.py), Python dependencies (abc, typing, pytest), 15 development constraints (Hexagonal Architecture, ABC usage, domain purity, logging standards), 2 repository interface signatures (ITaskRepository with 7 methods, IMemoryRepository with 9 methods), and 23 test ideas mapped to ACs. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.
- **2025-10-25**: Completed dev-story for Story 5.3 (Create Repository Interfaces - 2 pts). Implementation complete. Files created: mission-control/src/domain/repositories/__init__.py, task_repository.py (ITaskRepository: 7 methods), memory_repository.py (IMemoryRepository: 9 methods), tests/domain/repositories/test_repository_interfaces.py (25 tests). All 25 tests passing (100%). No regressions (556 total tests passing: 531 existing + 25 new). All 7 ACs met. Architecture compliance verified (Hexagonal/Clean, ABC usage, domain purity, complete type hints, 100% coverage). Story status: Ready for Review. Phase 1 Foundation (EPIC-5R) complete pending approval: 10/10 pts. Next: User (Mike) approval via review-story workflow.
- **2025-10-25**: Started EPIC-5R Phase 4: Presentation Layer. Created Story 6.4 (Create Formatters - 3 pts) with 7 acceptance criteria. Formatters: TaskFormatter, PlanningFormatter, BriefingFormatter, StatusFormatter. Zero business logic, pure presentation functions for Rich CLI output. 15+ tests planned. Story marked ready for development by SM agent. Status: Draft ‚Üí Ready. Next: Generate story-context, then DEV implements.
- **2025-10-25**: Completed story-context for Story 6.4 (Create Formatters). Context file: docs/stories/story-context-6.4-create-formatters.xml. Assembled comprehensive implementation context with 7 acceptance criteria, 5 documentation references (CLAUDE.md, epics.md, Stories 5.1 & 5.2, solution-architecture.md), 7 code artifacts (Task entity, value objects, existing workflows), Python dependencies (rich, typing, datetime), 12 development constraints (Hexagonal Architecture, zero business logic, Rich formatting standards), 13 formatter function interfaces, and 19 test ideas mapped to ACs. Next: DEV agent should run dev-story to implement.

## Notes

- This is a meta-project: using AI frameworks to build an AI-powered executive team
- Hybrid approach combines two methodologies (BMAD + Claude Agent SDK)
- Phase 3 (Solutioning) is REQUIRED for Level 4 projects
- UX-spec workflow added for CLI interface design and agent persona refinement
- Documentation complete: See D:\Mission Control\docs\index.md for navigation
