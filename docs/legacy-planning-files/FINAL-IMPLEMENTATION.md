# Mission Control - Final Implementation

## Status: ✅ READY TO USE

Mission Control is now properly implemented using the Claude Agent SDK patterns from Kenneth Liao's tutorial.

---

## How to Run

### From Terminal (Outside Claude Code)

```bash
cd "D:\Mission Control\mission-control-system"
PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 uv run python main.py
```

Or on Windows CMD:
```cmd
cd "D:\Mission Control\mission-control-system"
uv run python main.py
```

## Architecture

### Based on Kenneth Liao's Patterns

This implementation follows the patterns from `claude-agent-sdk-intro/6_subagents.py`:

1. **Concise Agent Definitions**: Each specialist has a short, focused prompt (~2-3 sentences)
2. **Inline Agent Configuration**: Agents defined directly in `ClaudeAgentOptions.agents={}`
3. **Task Tool Delegation**: Chief of Staff uses Task tool to delegate to specialists
4. **Clean Message Parsing**: Uses Kenneth's message handling patterns from `cli_tools.py`

### Main Components

#### 1. Chief of Staff (Alex)
- **Role**: Primary interface, orchestrator
- **Prompt**: Set via initial `client.query()` call
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle general conversations
  - Decide when to delegate to specialists
  - Coordinate multi-agent workflows
  - Maintain context across session

#### 2. Five Specialist Subagents

**Strategist**
- Long-term vision (10-year, 3-year, 1-year)
- Core values definition
- Strategic opportunity evaluation
- Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite, WebSearch, WebFetch

**Planner (Quinn)**
- Quarterly planning (90-day Rocks)
- Goal tracking and progress monitoring
- Accountability and milestones
- Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite

**Operator (Taylor)**
- Daily planning and execution
- Task prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix)
- Time blocking and focus management
- Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite

**Analyst**
- Business metrics and KPIs
- Trend analysis and insights
- Dashboard generation
- Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite, WebSearch

**Researcher**
- Deep research on any topic
- Competitive analysis
- Comprehensive reports with citations
- Tools: Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, TodoWrite, WebSearch, WebFetch

## Key Differences from v1.0 and v2.0

### v1.0 (Subprocess - FAILED)
- Tried to pass 10KB Chief of Staff prompt on command line
- Hit Windows command line length limit
- Nested Claude instances
- ❌ Didn't work

### v2.0 (Slash Command - WRONG APPROACH)
- Tried to run inside Claude Code via slash commands
- Lost the autonomous agent framework vision
- Too dependent on Claude Code structures
- ❌ Not what we wanted

### v3.0 (Current - CORRECT)
- Follows Kenneth Liao's patterns exactly
- Concise agent definitions (~200 chars each)
- Runs as standalone terminal app
- Uses SDK properly for autonomous behaviors
- ✅ Works as intended!

## How Delegation Works

```
User: "Help me plan my quarter"
  ↓
Alex (Chief of Staff) recognizes: quarterly planning task
  ↓
Alex uses Task tool to delegate to "planner" subagent
  ↓
Quinn (Planner) facilitates quarterly planning session
  ↓
Quinn creates data/goals/2025-Q4-rocks.json
  ↓
Quinn returns results to Alex
  ↓
Alex summarizes and presents to user
```

## Example Interactions

### Daily Planning
```
You: Help me plan my day

Alex: Let me bring in Taylor, our Operator, who specializes in daily execution.
[Delegates to operator subagent]

Taylor: Let's plan your day using the Eisenhower Matrix...
[Facilitates daily planning]
```

### Strategic Thinking
```
You: I'm thinking about our 10-year vision

Alex: This is perfect for the Strategist. Let me hand you over.
[Delegates to strategist subagent]

Strategist: Let's start with some probing questions about your vision...
[Facilitates vision articulation session]
```

### Research Task
```
You: Research AI agent frameworks for me

Alex: I'll delegate this to our Researcher for comprehensive analysis.
[Delegates to researcher subagent]

Researcher: I'll conduct deep research and create a detailed report...
[Performs research, creates docs/ai-agent-frameworks-research.md]
```

## What's Different in v3.0

### Agent Definitions
**v1.0**: Tried to pass via `agents=agents` from src/agent_definitions.py (too long)
**v3.0**: Inline in main.py with concise prompts (~200 chars each)

### Chief of Staff
**v1.0**: Tried to load 10KB output-style file via command line
**v3.0**: Set via initial `client.query()` with concise prompt

### Message Parsing
**v1.0**: Custom parse_message() with dict assumptions
**v3.0**: Direct isinstance() checks like Kenneth's cli_tools.py

### Execution
**v1.0**: Tried to run from within Claude Code
**v3.0**: Runs as standalone terminal app (correct!)

## Technical Details

### SDK Configuration
```python
options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    permission_mode="acceptEdits",
    setting_sources=["project"],
    allowed_tools=['Read', 'Write', 'Edit', 'MultiEdit', 'Grep', 'Glob',
                   'Task', 'TodoWrite', 'WebSearch', 'WebFetch', 'Bash'],
    agents={
        "strategist": AgentDefinition(...),
        "planner": AgentDefinition(...),
        "operator": AgentDefinition(...),
        "analyst": AgentDefinition(...),
        "researcher": AgentDefinition(...)
    }
)
```

### No More Issues
- ✅ No Windows command line length errors
- ✅ No nested Claude instances
- ✅ No message parsing errors
- ✅ No authentication issues
- ✅ Chief of Staff persona works
- ✅ Subagent delegation works

## Next Steps (EPIC-1 Complete!)

Mission Control v3.0 implements the foundation for EPIC-1: Autonomous Agent Framework

**What's Working:**
- Chief of Staff orchestrator (Alex)
- 5 specialist subagents (Strategist, Planner, Operator, Analyst, Researcher)
- Proper delegation via Task tool
- Conversation memory within session
- Kenneth Liao's proven patterns

**What's Next (Future Epics):**
- Persistent memory across sessions (data/ directory usage)
- Scheduled autonomous behaviors (daily briefings, weekly reviews)
- Event-driven triggers (goal off-track alerts)
- Learning and pattern recognition
- Proactive insights and notifications
