## Project Context

**Project Description:**
Mission Control is a hybrid system combining BMAD Method patterns for workflow structure with Claude Agent SDK for autonomous AI agents. It's a Python-based autonomous executive team featuring a Chief of Staff plus 5 specialist subagents (Strategist, Planner, Operator, Analyst, Researcher) with persistent memory and proactive behaviors.

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.13+
- Claude Agent SDK
- BMAD Method patterns
- Rich CLI interface
- MCP integrations

**Key Features:**
- Autonomous agents that work proactively
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Scheduled operations (daily briefings, weekly reviews)
- Specialist subagent delegation
- Self-extending system

**Has UI Components:** Yes (CLI interface with Rich formatting, agent personas)

**Documentation Status:** Partial
- Architecture documentation exists
- Product backlog complete
- Implementation guide ready
- Code structure needs documentation

---

## Next Action

**What to do next:** Run document-project workflow to analyze and document the brownfield codebase

**Command to run:** `document-project`

**Agent to load:** Analyst (or current agent - bmad-master)

**Why this step:** Before planning and implementation, we need comprehensive documentation of:
- Existing project structure
- Current implementation status
- BMAD integration points
- Claude Agent SDK integration
- File organization and patterns

---

## Implementation Progress (Phase 4 Only)

*Not yet in Phase 4*

---

## Decisions Log

- **2025-10-14**: Created workflow status file. Project identified as Level 4 (Enterprise scale). Brownfield project with partial documentation. Starting with document-project workflow to analyze existing codebase before planning. UX workflow included due to CLI UI components.

---

## Notes

- This is a meta-project: using AI frameworks to build an AI-powered executive team
- Hybrid approach combines two methodologies (BMAD + Claude Agent SDK)
- Phase 3 (Solutioning) is REQUIRED for Level 4 projects
- UX-spec workflow added for CLI interface design and agent persona refinement
- Documentation exists but needs consolidation for brownfield analysis
