# EPIC-1: Autonomous Agent Framework

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Foundation)
**Epic Owner:** Technical Lead
**Business Value:** Foundation for all autonomous behaviors - agents that work FOR you, not just respond TO you

---

## Epic Goal

Build the core autonomous agent framework that enables AI agents to:
- Operate independently in the background
- Monitor context and surface insights proactively
- Maintain persistent memory across sessions
- Learn user preferences over time
- Initiate conversations based on patterns/triggers

**This is NOT standard BMAD** - we're building truly autonomous agents, not just conversational facilitators.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Agent can maintain persistent state across sessions
- [ ] Agent can trigger proactive notifications/insights
- [ ] Agent learns from interactions (preferences, patterns)
- [ ] Agent operates on schedules (daily briefings, weekly reviews)
- [ ] Agent monitors business context autonomously
- [ ] Memory system persists and retrieves context efficiently

## Key Differentiators from BMAD

| Standard BMAD | Mission Control Autonomous |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Reactive (user triggers workflows) | **Proactive (agents initiate based on triggers)** |
| Stateless (no memory between sessions) | **Persistent memory (remembers everything)** |
| Facilitator (guides user through steps) | **Autonomous (works independently, surfaces results)** |
| One-time workflows | **Scheduled + event-driven + ad-hoc** |
| No learning | **Learns preferences and patterns** |

---

## Technical Components

### 1. Persistent Memory System
**Location:** `bmad/mission-control/memory/`

**Structure:**
```yaml
memory/
├── business-context.yaml      # Company info, goals, projects
├── user-preferences.yaml      # Work style, communication preferences
├── interaction-history.json   # All conversations, decisions
├── patterns.yaml              # Learned patterns and insights
└── agent-state/               # Per-agent state
    ├── chief-of-staff.yaml
    ├── strategist.yaml
    ├── planner.yaml
    ├── operator.yaml
    └── analyst.yaml
```

### 2. Autonomous Agent Architecture
**New agent metadata:**
```yaml
agent:
  autonomous_capabilities:
    scheduled_tasks:
      - trigger: "daily 6:30am"
        action: "generate_morning_briefing"
      - trigger: "friday 4pm"
        action: "generate_weekly_review"

    event_monitors:
      - event: "goal_off_track"
        action: "notify_user"
      - event: "new_opportunity_mentioned"
        action: "capture_to_backlog"

    learning_behaviors:
      - "track_decision_patterns"
      - "identify_productivity_times"
      - "learn_communication_style"
```

### 3. Proactive Notification System
**Triggers:**
- Time-based (scheduled briefings)
- Event-based (goal goes off track)
- Pattern-based (user mentions same issue 3 times)
- Context-based (important deadline approaching)

### 4. Background Processing Engine
Agents work continuously, not just when invoked:
- Monitor goals/projects for changes
- Track metrics and identify trends
- Prepare briefings in advance
- Surface insights when relevant

## User Stories (High-Level)

1. **Memory System**
   - Store business context persistently
   - Store user preferences
   - Track interaction history
   - Learn patterns over time

2. **Scheduled Operations**
   - Generate daily briefings automatically
   - Execute weekly reviews on schedule
   - Monthly strategic check-ins

3. **Event-Driven Behaviors**
   - Detect when goal goes off track
   - Notice repeated mentions of issues
   - Flag approaching deadlines

4. **Proactive Insights**
   - Surface patterns user may not see
   - Suggest actions based on context
   - Challenge assumptions when appropriate

5. **Learning Capabilities**
   - Adapt to user's communication style
   - Learn best times for different activities
   - Understand decision-making patterns

---

## Dependencies

- BMAD Method v6-alpha installed
- Mission Control module structure created
- Understanding of agent persistence patterns

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Persistent memory gets too large or corrupted
**Mitigation:** Version control memory files, implement cleanup/archival

**Risk:** Autonomous agents become annoying ("Clippy syndrome")
**Mitigation:** User controls notification frequency, can disable any behavior

**Risk:** Learning system reinforces bad patterns
**Mitigation:** User can review and correct learned patterns

---

## Acceptance Criteria for Epic

- [ ] Memory system stores and retrieves data reliably
- [ ] At least one agent demonstrates scheduled behavior (daily briefing)
- [ ] At least one event-driven behavior works (e.g., goal tracking alert)
- [ ] User can review what agents have learned
- [ ] User can configure notification preferences
- [ ] System survives restart with full context restoration

## Stories in Epic

- STORY-1.1: Persistent memory system architecture
- STORY-1.2: Business context storage
- STORY-1.3: User preferences tracking
- STORY-1.4: Interaction history logging
- STORY-1.5: Scheduled task execution framework
- STORY-1.6: Event detection system

## Estimated Effort

**Epic Total:** 40-50 story points (approx. 2-3 weeks)

**Complexity:** High - This is net-new functionality beyond standard BMAD

**Value:** Critical - Everything else depends on this foundation
