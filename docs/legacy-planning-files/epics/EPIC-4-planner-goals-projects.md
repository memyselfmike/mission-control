# EPIC-4: Planner (Goals & Projects Agent)

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** P1 (High - Strategic Execution)
**Epic Owner:** Product Lead
**Business Value:** Translates vision into achievable plans, tracks progress autonomously, ensures goals don't slip

---

## Epic Goal

Build the Planner agent (Quinn) that manages goals, projects, and quarterly planning. This agent:
- Helps set measurable goals (quarterly, annual, multi-year)
- Breaks goals into executable projects/milestones
- Tracks progress autonomously
- Flags when goals go off track
- Suggests re-prioritization when needed
- Facilitates quarterly planning sessions

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can set goals at multiple time horizons
- [ ] Goals tracked automatically with status updates
- [ ] Agent proactively flags off-track goals
- [ ] Quarterly planning workflow provides clarity
- [ ] Progress visible at a glance
- [ ] Agent suggests adjustments when needed

---

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Goal Setting (Framework Agnostic)
Supports multiple approaches:
- **OKRs** (Objectives & Key Results)
- **Rocks** (EOS-style quarterly priorities)
- **SMART Goals** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
- **Custom** (User defines their own structure)

### 2. Goal Tracking
- Status: On Track, At Risk, Off Track, Complete
- Progress indicators (% complete, milestones hit)
- Automatic status updates based on task completion
- Timeline tracking (days remaining)

### 3. Quarterly Planning
Structured planning sessions:
- Review last quarter (what worked/didn't)
- Set 3-7 priorities for next 90 days
- Define success criteria
- Identify resources needed
- Anticipate obstacles

### 4. Progress Monitoring (Autonomous)
- Checks goal status daily
- Flags when progress stalls
- Notices when deadline approaching
- Tracks completion patterns

### 5. Project Planning
Break goals into:
- Milestones
- Tasks (delegates to Operator)
- Dependencies
- Resources needed

### 6. Strategic Alignment
- Links quarterly goals to annual vision
- Ensures daily tasks ladder up to goals
- Identifies misalignment

## Quarterly Planning Workflow (Detailed)

```markdown
<workflow name="quarterly-planning">

<step n="1" goal="Review last quarter">
Let's start by reviewing last quarter (Q3 2025).

You set 5 goals:
‚úÖ Goal 1: Achieve $50K revenue (DONE - $52K actual)
‚úÖ Goal 2: Hire 2 team members (DONE)
‚ö†Ô∏è  Goal 3: Launch marketing campaign (PARTIAL - launched but underperformed)
‚ùå Goal 4: Build iOS app (NOT COMPLETED - deprioritized)
‚úÖ Goal 5: Establish partnerships (DONE - 3 partnerships)

**Success rate: 60% complete, 20% partial**

What worked well last quarter?
What didn't work?
What did you learn?

<template-output>quarter_review</template-output>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Define planning horizon">
Now let's set your priorities for Q4 2025 (Oct 1 - Dec 31).

What's most important for the business this quarter?
- Revenue growth?
- Product development?
- Team building?
- Market expansion?
- Something else?

<template-output>focus_areas</template-output>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Set quarterly goals">
Based on your focus, let's define 3-7 goals for Q4.

Remember the criteria:
- Specific and measurable
- Achievable in 90 days
- Significant impact on business
- Clear success criteria

For each goal, tell me:
- What is it?
- How will you measure success?
- Why is this important?

<template-output>quarterly_goals</template-output>
<invoke-task halt="true">{project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/adv-elicit.xml</invoke-task>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Define milestones">
For each goal, let's break it into 3-5 milestones.

[For Goal 1: Launch new product line]

What are the key milestones to get there?

Example:
- Milestone 1: Complete market research (Oct 31)
- Milestone 2: Build MVP (Nov 30)
- Milestone 3: First paying customer (Dec 15)

<template-output>milestones</template-output>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Identify dependencies">
What do you need to achieve these goals?
- Budget/resources?
- Team support?
- External partners?
- Technology/tools?

What could block progress?

<template-output>dependencies</template-output>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Reality check">
Okay, let's reality check this plan.

You have 13 weeks in Q4.
You're setting X goals with Y total milestones.

Based on Q3 (60% completion rate), is this realistic?

Too ambitious? Too conservative? Just right?

<template-output>reality_check</template-output>
</step>

<step n="7" goal="Prioritize">
If you could only complete 3 of these goals, which 3 would have the biggest impact?

This helps when we need to make trade-offs mid-quarter.

<template-output>prioritization</template-output>
</step>

<step n="8" goal="Set check-in cadence">
How do you want to track these?

I suggest:
- Weekly: Quick progress pulse (5 min)
- Mid-quarter (Nov 15): Deep review, adjust if needed
- End of quarter (Dec 31): Full retrospective

Work for you?

<template-output>check_in_schedule</template-output>
</step>

<step n="9" goal="Generate Q4 plan">
Perfect. Generating your Q4 2025 plan...

[Agent creates structured document]

Saved to: {output_folder}/Q4-2025-Plan.md

I'll track these autonomously and flag if anything goes off track.

Let's execute. üìä

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** User doesn't complete quarterly planning (too long)
**Mitigation:** Allow incremental planning, save progress

**Risk:** Goals become stale/ignored
**Mitigation:** Autonomous monitoring flags lack of progress

**Risk:** Too many goals = nothing gets done
**Mitigation:** Agent suggests 3-7 max, challenges if too many
