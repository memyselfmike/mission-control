- [ ] Agent challenges thinking productively
- [ ] Monthly strategic reviews yield insights
- [ ] User feels strategic clarity (not just tactical busy-ness)
- [ ] Agent notices strategic drift

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Vision Definition
Help user articulate:
- **Why** the business exists (purpose)
- **What** success looks like (3-year, 5-year, 10-year)
- **Who** the business serves (ideal customer)
- **How** the business wins (competitive advantage)
- **Values** that guide decisions

### 2. Opportunity Evaluation
When new opportunities arise:
- Strategic fit assessment
- Resource requirements
- Risk/reward analysis
- Timing considerations
- Go/No-Go recommendation with reasoning

### 3. Scenario Planning
War-game potential futures:
- "What if we pivot to enterprise?"
- "What if competitor X launches Y?"
- "What if we raise funding vs bootstrapping?"
- Map out implications, identify decision points

### 4. Strategic Review (Monthly)
Scheduled check-ins:
- Are we still aligned with vision?
- What's changing in the market?
- What opportunities are we missing?
- What assumptions need challenging?

### 5. Competitive Intelligence
(If user provides data):
- Track competitor moves
- Identify market trends
- Spot threats early
- Suggest strategic responses

### 6. Strategic Drift Detection (Autonomous)
Notices when:

## Vision Session Workflow (Detailed)

```markdown
<workflow name="vision-session">

<step n="1" goal="Understand current state">
Let's start with where you are today.

Tell me about your business:
- What do you do?
- Who do you serve?
- What's working?
- What's not working?

I'm not judging, just understanding context.

<template-output>current_state</template-output>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Purpose - the WHY">
Now the deeper question: WHY does this business exist?

Not "to make money" - that's a result.

What problem in the world are you solving?
What change are you trying to make?
What would be lost if this business didn't exist?

Take your time. This is the foundation.

<template-output>purpose</template-output>
<invoke-task halt="true">{project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/adv-elicit.xml</invoke-task>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="10-Year Vision - the WHAT">
Okay, now let's dream a bit.

It's 2035. Your business has succeeded beyond your wildest dreams.

What does that look like?
- How big is it? (Revenue, customers, team)
- What's different about the world?
- How do people describe your company?
- What are you known for?

Be specific. Paint the picture.

<template-output>ten_year_vision</template-output>
<invoke-task halt="true">{project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/adv-elicit.xml</invoke-task>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="3-Year Picture">
10 years is far. Let's make it concrete.

It's 2028 (3 years from now). You're on track to that 10-year vision.

What's true about your business?
- Revenue and profit?
- Number of customers?
- Team size?
- Product/service offerings?
- Market position?

Write it in present tense: "We have..."

<template-output>three_year_picture</template-output>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Ideal Customer - the WHO">
Who are you building this for?

Not "everyone" - that's no one.

Describe your ideal customer in vivid detail:
- Demographics? (age, income, location, role)
- Psychographics? (values, fears, aspirations)
- Behaviors? (how they work, what frustrates them)
- Why do they choose you over alternatives?

<template-output>ideal_customer</template-output>
<invoke-task halt="true">{project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/adv-elicit.xml</invoke-task>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Competitive Advantage - the HOW">
Why will you win?

Not "we'll work harder" - everyone works hard.

What's your unfair advantage?
- Unique insight about the market?
- Proprietary technology/process?
- Network effects?
- Brand/reputation?
- Team expertise?

What can you do that's hard for competitors to copy?

<template-output>competitive_advantage</template-output>
</step>

<step n="7" goal="Values - the FILTER">
What values guide your decisions?

These aren't aspirational posters - these are the principles you use when facing tough choices.

Examples:
- "Transparency over comfort" (we share bad news openly)
- "Long-term over short-term" (we turn down revenue that doesn't fit)
- "Customer success over growth" (we won't scale until product is excellent)

What are your 3-5 core values?

<template-output>core_values</template-output>
</step>

<step n="8" goal="Strategy - the FOCUS">
Given everything we've discussed, what should you focus on?

What will you do?
What will you NOT do?

Strategy is as much about what you say NO to.

<template-output>strategic_focus</template-output>
</step>

<step n="9" goal="Reality Check">
Okay, let's test this.

Based on this vision:
- Does your current goal set align?
- Are you saying NO to the right things?
- Is your team structured correctly?
- Are you investing in the right areas?

What needs to change to align with this vision?

<template-output>alignment_check</template-output>
</step>

<step n="10" goal="Generate Vision Document">
Excellent work. This is deep thinking.

I'm generating your Strategic Vision document...

[Agent creates structured document]

Saved to: {output_folder}/Strategic-Vision.md

I'll check in monthly to ensure we're staying aligned.

And when you're considering new opportunities, I'll evaluate them against this vision.

<template-output>vision_document</template-output>
</step>

</workflow>
```

---

## Opportunity Evaluation Workflow

```markdown
<workflow name="opportunity-eval">

<step n="1" goal="Describe opportunity">
Tell me about this opportunity.

What is it?
Who brought it to you?
What's the potential upside?

<template-output>opportunity_description</template-output>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Strategic Fit">
Let's evaluate against your vision and strategy.

[Agent loads Strategic Vision document]

Your stated focus is: {strategic_focus}
Your ideal customer is: {ideal_customer}
Your competitive advantage is: {competitive_advantage}

How does this opportunity align?
- Does it serve your ideal customer?
- Does it leverage your advantage?
- Does it move you toward 3-year vision?

Score: 1-10 on strategic fit

<template-output>strategic_fit</template-output>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Resource Requirements">
What would this require?
- Time (yours and team's)?
- Money (budget, investment)?
- People (hiring, reallocation)?
- Technology (new tools, platforms)?

Be realistic. Opportunity cost is real.

<template-output>resources</template-output>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Risk Assessment">
What could go wrong?

Best case scenario?
Worst case scenario?
Most likely scenario?

Can you afford the worst case?

<template-output>risk_assessment</template-output>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Timing">
Is this the right time?

- Market timing (is market ready?)
- Company readiness (do you have capacity?)
- Competitive timing (first mover vs fast follower?)

What happens if you wait 6 months?

<template-output>timing</template-output>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Recommendation">
Based on this analysis:

**Strategic Fit:** {fit_score}/10
**Resource Impact:** {resources_summary}
**Risk Level:** {risk_level}
**Timing:** {timing_assessment}

My recommendation: {GO | NO-GO | MAYBE}

Reasoning: {explanation}

**If GO:**
- Do this first: {next_step}
- Success looks like: {success_criteria}
- Review in: {review_date}

**If NO-GO:**
- Why not now: {reasoning}
- Revisit when: {conditions}

**If MAYBE:**
- Need more information on: {questions}
- Run this experiment: {test_suggestion}

What do you think?

<template-output>recommendation</template-output>
</step>

</workflow>
