## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture: Hybrid Approach

**Claude Agent SDK** provides:
- Autonomous agent behaviors
- Subagent spawning and delegation
- Hooks for event-driven actions
- MCP for external tool integration
- Persistent conversation context

**BMAD Method Patterns** provide:
- Workflow structure and organization
- Document templates
- Process frameworks (Eisenhower Matrix, Rocks, etc.)

### Implementation Language: Python

- Python 3.13+ required
- `uv` package manager for dependencies
- Async/await for agent interactions
- Rich library for CLI formatting

### Core Components

1. **Main Agent (Chief of Staff)**
   - Defined by output style (`.claude/output-styles/chief-of-staff.md`)
   - Primary interface for user
   - Routes to specialist subagents
   - Maintains persistent context

2. **Subagents (5 Specialists)**
   - Strategist: Long-term vision
   - Planner: Quarterly goals
   - Operator: Daily execution
   - Analyst: Business intelligence
   - Researcher: Deep research

3. **Autonomous Behaviors**
   - Hooks triggered by events (Stop, PostToolUse, Notification)
   - Python scripts in `.claude/hooks/`
   - Goal monitoring, pattern detection, action logging

4. **Persistent Memory**
   - File-based storage in `data/memory/`
   - Business context, user preferences, interaction logs
   - Loaded at conversation start for context persistence

5. **MCP Integration**
   - Playwright for browser automation
   - Future: Calendar, email, metrics APIs
