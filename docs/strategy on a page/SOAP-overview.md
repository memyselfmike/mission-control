Alright, let’s roll up our sleeves and get into the nitty-gritty of how you actually draw up each section of the Strategy on a Page (SOAP). This isn’t just theory—it’s about practical steps to get your strategy out of your head and onto a single, actionable page. Here’s how to tackle each section:

1\. Purpose

What to Do: Start by asking the big, bold question: Why does this business exist? This isn’t about profit—it’s about impact. What value do you bring to the world? What problem are you solving? Write it down in one clear, concise sentence.

Practical Tip: Use the “5 Whys” technique. Keep asking “Why?” until you drill down to the core reason your business exists. For example:

Why do we sell software? To help businesses grow.

Why do we want to help them grow? To create opportunities.

Why is that important? Because opportunities change lives.

Outcome: A purpose statement that’s short, memorable, and inspiring. Think: “We exist to empower small businesses to thrive in a digital world.”

2\. Vision

What to Do: Paint a vivid picture of where you want to be in 3-5 years. This is your North Star. It should be ambitious but achievable. Ask yourself: What does success look like?

Practical Tip: Use the “Future Press Release” exercise. Imagine it’s five years from now, and a journalist is writing about your company’s success. What would the headline say? What milestones would they highlight?

Outcome: A vision statement that’s forward-looking and energizing. For example: “To be the leading provider of AI-driven solutions for sustainable agriculture by 2030.”

3\. Values

What to Do: Define the principles that guide your decisions and behavior. These are the non-negotiables—the DNA of your culture. Ask: What do we stand for? What behaviors do we expect from our team?

Practical Tip: Involve your team. Host a workshop where everyone shares the values they believe define your business. Look for common themes and distill them into 3-5 core values.

Outcome: A set of values that are actionable, not just aspirational. For example:

Integrity: We do what we say we’ll do.

Innovation: We challenge the status quo.

Customer First: We succeed when our customers succeed.

4\. Market Positioning

What to Do: Identify your Unique Selling Proposition (USP) and define your place in the market. Ask: What makes us different? Who are we serving? What’s our promise to them?

Practical Tip: Use the “Positioning Triangle”:

Customer Need: What problem are you solving?

Competitor Gap: What are your competitors missing?

Your Strength: What do you do better than anyone else?

Outcome: A clear positioning statement. For example: “We are the only cloud-based platform that integrates AI with real-time analytics to help small retailers increase sales.”

5\. Business Growth Indicators

What to Do: Define the metrics that matter. These are your KPIs—the numbers that tell you if you’re on track. Ask: What are the key drivers of growth in our business?

Practical Tip: Use the SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to set your KPIs. For example:

Increase monthly recurring revenue (MRR) by 20% in the next 12 months.

Reduce customer churn to below 5% by Q4.

Outcome: A short list of measurable goals that align with your strategy.

6\. Strategy Implementation

What to Do: Break your strategy into actionable steps. This is where the rubber meets the road. Ask: What do we need to do to achieve our vision?

Practical Tip: Use the “12-Week Year” framework. Instead of annual goals, focus on quarterly sprints. For each goal, define:

What: The specific action to take.

Who: The person responsible.

When: The deadline.

Outcome: A clear action plan with accountability. For example:

Launch new product feature by March 31 (Product Team).

Increase LinkedIn engagement by 50% by April 15 (Marketing Team).

7\. Alignment Across Functions

What to Do: Ensure every department is aligned with the strategy. This is about breaking silos and creating a unified focus. Ask: How does each team contribute to the overall strategy?

Practical Tip: Use a cascading goals approach. Start with the company-wide strategy, then break it down into departmental goals, and finally into individual objectives.

Outcome: A cohesive plan where everyone knows their role in achieving the strategy.

Putting It All Together

Once you’ve worked through each section, it’s time to consolidate everything onto a single page. Here’s how:

Layout: Use a simple grid or flowchart format. Start with Purpose at the top, followed by Vision, Values, Market Positioning, Growth Indicators, and Strategy Implementation.

Design: Keep it clean and visually appealing. Use bullet points, bold headings, and color coding to make it easy to read.

Review: Share it with your team and get feedback. This isn’t a static document—it’s a living, breathing strategy that evolves with your business.

Final Thought

SOAP isn’t just a tool—it’s a mindset. It forces clarity, alignment, and focus. And when you get it right, it’s like having a compass that keeps your entire organization moving in the same direction. So, Mike, grab your team, get in a room, and start mapping this out. The work you put in now will pay dividends for years to come. Let me know how you get on!

Absolutely, Mike. Those five core areas—Talent, Sales, Marketing, Operations, and Finance—are the backbone of any business strategy, and they’re central to the Strategy on a Page (SOAP) framework. Each one plays a distinct role, and together, they create a balanced, scalable foundation. Let’s break them down and look at how they fit into SOAP.

1\. Talent

What It Means: Talent is about your people—your team, your culture, and your leadership. It’s the human engine that drives everything else. Without the right people in the right roles, even the best strategy will fall flat.

Key Questions to Ask:

Do we have the right people in the right seats?

Are our leaders equipped to scale the business?

Is our culture aligned with our values and vision?

Practical Steps:

Conduct a talent audit: Look at your team’s strengths, gaps, and development needs.

Define roles and responsibilities clearly: Ambiguity kills execution.

Invest in leadership development: Scaling a business requires leaders who can grow with it.

SOAP Integration: Talent ties directly to your values and alignment. It’s about ensuring your people embody the culture you’re building and have the skills to execute the strategy.

2\. Sales

What It Means: Sales is the lifeblood of your business. It’s about converting leads into revenue and building relationships that drive growth. But it’s not just about closing deals—it’s about creating a scalable, repeatable sales process.

Key Questions to Ask:

Do we have a clear sales strategy?

Are our sales processes scalable?

Are we measuring the right metrics (e.g., conversion rates, pipeline velocity)?

Practical Steps:

Build a sales playbook: Document your sales process from lead generation to close.

Train your team: Sales isn’t just an art—it’s a skill that can be developed.

Use technology: CRM systems and analytics tools can help you scale.

SOAP Integration: Sales connects to your business growth indicators. It’s about setting measurable targets (e.g., revenue, customer acquisition) and tracking progress.

3\. Marketing

What It Means: Marketing is about creating demand. It’s how you position your business, attract leads, and build your brand. It’s the front end of the customer journey, setting the stage for sales.

Key Questions to Ask:

What’s our Unique Selling Proposition (USP)?

Are we targeting the right audience?

Are we measuring ROI on our marketing efforts?

Practical Steps:

Define your positioning: Be crystal clear on what makes you different.

Create a content strategy: Use blogs, videos, and social media to engage your audience.

Measure everything: Use analytics to track what’s working and what’s not.

SOAP Integration: Marketing ties into your market positioning and growth indicators. It’s about aligning your messaging with your purpose and vision.

4\. Operations

What It Means: Operations is the engine room of your business. It’s about delivering on your promises—efficiently, consistently, and at scale. If sales and marketing bring customers in, operations keeps them happy.

Key Questions to Ask:

Are our processes scalable?

Do we have the right systems in place?

At what point will our operations break under growth?

Practical Steps:

Map your processes: Document how work gets done, from order to delivery.

Invest in systems: Automation and technology can help you scale without adding headcount.

Monitor capacity: Know your limits and plan for growth.

SOAP Integration: Operations connects to strategy implementation. It’s about ensuring you can deliver on your vision without compromising quality or efficiency.

5\. Finance

What It Means: Finance is the glue that holds everything together. It’s about managing cash flow, funding growth, and ensuring profitability. Without a solid financial strategy, even the best ideas can crumble.

Key Questions to Ask:

Do we have a clear financial plan?

Are we managing cash flow effectively?

Do we have the funding we need to scale?

Practical Steps:

Create a financial dashboard: Track key metrics like revenue, expenses, and cash flow.

Plan for growth: Know how much capital you’ll need and where it will come from.

Manage risk: Have a plan for dealing with financial challenges.

SOAP Integration: Finance ties into your business growth indicators. It’s about setting financial targets and ensuring you have the resources to achieve them.

How These Fit Together in SOAP

In the Strategy on a Page framework, these five areas aren’t standalone—they’re interconnected. Here’s how they come together:

Purpose and Vision: Talent, sales, marketing, operations, and finance all align with your purpose and vision. They’re the “how” behind the “why.”

Values: Talent and culture are directly tied to your values. They shape how you operate and interact with customers.

Market Positioning: Marketing and sales define your positioning and how you communicate it to the world.

Growth Indicators: Finance, sales, and marketing provide the metrics that show whether you’re on track.

Implementation: Operations and talent ensure you can execute your strategy effectively.

Final Thought

Mike, these five areas are like the gears in a machine. If one isn’t working, the whole system suffers. But when they’re aligned and optimized, they create unstoppable momentum. SOAP forces you to think about each area strategically, ensuring nothing gets overlooked. So, take a hard look at your business—where are the gaps? Where are the opportunities? That’s where the magic happens. Let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific area! \[1]\[2]\[3]\[4]\[5]\[6]\[7]\[8]
