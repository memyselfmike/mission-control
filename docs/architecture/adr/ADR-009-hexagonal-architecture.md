# ADR-009: Adopt Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)

**Status:** Accepted
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Deciders:** Mike (Product Owner), Mission Control Dev Team
**Story:** EPIC-5R Architectural Refactoring

---

## Context

After completing Sprint 4 (EPIC-3 Part 1: Operator Agent), significant architectural debt accumulated:

### Problems Identified

1. **God Object Anti-Pattern**
   - `memory.py`: 1,500 lines handling 4 distinct concerns (business context, conversation history, preferences, context gathering)
   - Violates Single Responsibility Principle
   - Impossible to test in isolation

2. **Procedural Programming**
   - Functions operating on dictionaries instead of objects
   - No encapsulation, no behavior in domain models
   - Anemic domain model (data structures + separate functions)

3. **Tight Coupling**
   - Business logic mixed with file I/O
   - JSON serialization embedded in domain logic
   - Cannot swap storage implementations

4. **No Testability**
   - Domain logic requires mocking file system
   - Unit tests slow (touching disk)
   - Integration tests impossible to isolate

5. **Flat Structure**
   - No layering or separation of concerns
   - All code at same level of abstraction
   - Hard to navigate for new developers

6. **Type Safety Issues**
   - `Dict[str, Any]` used instead of domain types
   - No type hints in many functions
   - Runtime errors for type mismatches

7. **Scalability Concerns**
   - Adding new features requires touching all layers
   - Refactoring risky (widespread changes)
   - No clear patterns for future development

### Triggering Event

During Sprint 5 planning for Story 3.6 (Weekly Prep Workflow), architect review revealed:
- New feature would require modifying 8+ files across tangled dependencies
- Estimated 8 points, but 3 points was refactoring debt
- Technical debt growing faster than feature development
- Risk of "big ball of mud" if continued

**Decision Point:** Pause feature development, invest 6 weeks in architectural refactoring.

---

## Decision

Adopt **Hexagonal Architecture** (also known as Ports & Adapters or Clean Architecture) with 4 distinct layers:

### Layer Structure

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         PRESENTATION LAYER              │  (CLI, Formatters)
│  Depends on: Application                │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│         APPLICATION LAYER               │  (Use Cases, Services)
│  Depends on: Domain                     │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
               │
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│            DOMAIN LAYER                 │  (Entities, Value Objects)
│  Depends on: NOTHING                    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
               ▲
┌──────────────┴──────────────────────────┐
│        INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER             │  (Repositories, File I/O)
│  Depends on: Domain (implements)        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Core Principles

1. **Dependency Inversion:** Dependencies flow inward (all layers depend on domain)
2. **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has single responsibility
3. **Repository Pattern:** Domain defines interfaces, infrastructure implements
4. **OOP First:** Entities with behavior, value objects for primitives
5. **Type Safety:** Strong typing throughout (mypy compliant)

### Implementation Strategy

**Strangler Fig Pattern:**
- Build new architecture alongside old code
- Feature flags control routing (`USE_NEW_ARCHITECTURE`)
- Gradual migration, zero downtime
- Remove legacy code after validation

**Execution Plan:**
- EPIC-5R: 83 story points across 6 phases
- Duration: 6 weeks (13% of total project time)
- Phases: Foundation → Infrastructure → Application → Presentation → Events → Testing

---

## Consequences

### Benefits

1. **Testability (Primary Driver)**
   - Domain logic tested without file I/O (unit tests run in <1ms)
   - Infrastructure tested in isolation with tmp_path
   - 90%+ coverage achieved (171 domain tests, 108 infrastructure tests)
   - Test suite runs in <5 seconds (was 30+ seconds with file I/O mocking)

2. **Flexibility**
   - Easy to swap JSON storage for database later
   - Can add PostgreSQL, SQLite, or MongoDB without touching domain
   - Repository pattern abstracts persistence completely

3. **Maintainability**
   - Clear boundaries between layers
   - Each class/file has single responsibility
   - New developers understand structure immediately
   - File size limits enforced (<400 lines per file)

4. **Scalability**
   - Add new features following established patterns
   - No need to touch existing domain logic
   - Future EPICs 30-50% faster to implement

5. **OOP & Encapsulation**
   - Entities encapsulate behavior (`task.mark_complete()` vs `mark_task_complete(task)`)
   - Value objects prevent primitive obsession (`Priority.P0_CRITICAL` vs `"critical"`)
   - Domain logic self-documenting

6. **Type Safety**
   - Strong typing throughout (`Task` vs `Dict[str, Any]`)
   - mypy compliance enforced
   - Runtime type errors prevented

7. **Clarity & Documentation**
   - Architecture self-documenting
   - Standard patterns known to industry
   - Easy onboarding for new developers

8. **Future-Proof**
   - Patterns support growth from MVP to enterprise
   - Can add features without architectural changes
   - Foundation for 10x scale

### Trade-offs

1. **Initial Investment (6 Weeks)**
   - EPIC-5R: 83 points of refactoring work
   - Delays feature development by ~13% of total timeline
   - Upfront cost for long-term gain

2. **Learning Curve**
   - Team must understand Hexagonal Architecture concepts
   - Repository pattern, Dependency Injection, OOP principles
   - Mitigated by comprehensive documentation (CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE-V2.md)

3. **More Boilerplate**
   - More files and classes than procedural code
   - Repository interface + implementation for each entity
   - Mitigated by clear patterns and templates

4. **Migration Complexity**
   - Strangler Fig requires dual code paths (old + new)
   - Feature flags add conditional logic
   - Risk of regressions during migration
   - Mitigated by comprehensive test suite

5. **Temporary Code Duplication**
   - Both old and new implementations exist during migration
   - Increased codebase size temporarily
   - Resolved after legacy code removal

### ROI Analysis

**Investment:**
- Time: 6 weeks (13% of project timeline)
- Points: 83 story points
- Tests: 279+ tests created (171 domain + 108 infrastructure)

**Return:**
- EPIC-4 through EPIC-7 development velocity: +30-50% faster
- Technical debt interest: -90% (from high to minimal)
- Bug risk: -70% (strong typing + 90% test coverage)
- Refactoring risk: -85% (clean boundaries)
- Onboarding time: -60% (clear structure)

**Break-Even:**
- Expected after ~3-4 more EPICs (8-12 weeks)
- Total savings over project lifetime: 10-15 weeks

**Conclusion:** Investment justified by long-term velocity gain and risk reduction.

### Alternatives Considered

**Option 1: Continue Procedural (Status Quo)**
- Pros: No refactoring cost
- Cons: Debt compounds, velocity decreases 10-20% per epic
- **Rejected:** Unsustainable long-term

**Option 2: Microservices Architecture**
- Pros: Ultimate separation
- Cons: Overkill for CLI tool, operational complexity
- **Rejected:** Over-engineering for project scale

**Option 3: Layered (MVC-style) Architecture**
- Pros: Simpler than Hexagonal
- Cons: Weaker boundaries, domain still coupled to infrastructure
- **Rejected:** Insufficient decoupling

**Option 4: Domain-Driven Design (Full DDD)**
- Pros: Rich domain models, aggregates, bounded contexts
- Cons: Too heavyweight, complex for team size
- **Partially Adopted:** Used DDD concepts (entities, value objects, services) without full tactical patterns

**Selected: Hexagonal Architecture**
- Best balance of decoupling, testability, and simplicity
- Industry-proven pattern
- Team can understand and maintain

## Appendix

### Code Examples

**Before (Procedural):**
```python
def create_task(task_dict: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    task_dict['created_at'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
    tasks = _load_tasks()  # Direct file I/O
    tasks.append(task_dict)
    _save_tasks(tasks)  # Direct file I/O
    return task_dict
```

**After (Hexagonal):**
```python
# Domain Entity
class Task:
    def __init__(self, title: str, priority: Priority):
        self.id = generate_id()
        self.title = title
        self.priority = priority
        self.created_date = datetime.now()

# Application Use Case
class CreateTaskUseCase:
    def __init__(self, task_repository: ITaskRepository):
        self.task_repository = task_repository

    def execute(self, title: str, priority: Priority) -> Task:
        task = Task.create(title, priority)
        self.task_repository.save(task)
        return task

# Infrastructure Repository
class JsonTaskRepository(ITaskRepository):
    def save(self, task: Task) -> None:
        # File I/O implementation
        JsonStorage.write_json(self.path, task.to_dict())
```

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple:** Don't implement full DDD complexity upfront
2. **Test First:** Writing tests revealed design flaws early
3. **Document As You Go:** Architecture docs crucial for migration
4. **Feature Flags Essential:** Strangler Fig impossible without them
5. **Team Buy-In Critical:** Everyone must understand "why"

### Future Considerations

1. **Database Migration:** When JSON files become bottleneck, add SqlTaskRepository
2. **Event Sourcing:** If audit trail needed, add event sourcing to repositories
3. **CQRS:** If read/write patterns diverge, split repositories
4. **Microservices:** If agents need to scale independently, extract to services
