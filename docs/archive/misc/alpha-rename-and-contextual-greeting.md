# Alpha Rename & Contextual Greeting Update

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Type:** Enhancement
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed Chief of Staff: Alex → Alpha

**Files Updated:**
- `src/main.py` (8 occurrences)
- `src/preference_hooks.py` (1 occurrence)
- `src/preference_learning.py` (2 occurrences)

**Changed:**
- All user-facing references to "Alex" → "Alpha"
- Console output labels
- Logging agent names
- Documentation strings
- Variable names (alex_response_text → alpha_response_text)

### 2. Dynamic Contextual Greeting

**Old Behavior:**
```
Alpha: Hello! I'm Alpha, your Chief of Staff. How can I help you today?
```
Generic, boring, no awareness of system state.

**New Behavior:**
Alpha now:
1. **Uses Glob tool** to check system files:
   - Recent conversation history
   - Pattern analysis files
   - Pending request files
   - System activity

2. **Uses Read tool** to check:
   - Latest conversation timestamps
   - When you last talked
   - Any pending tasks

3. **Crafts personalized greeting** mentioning:
   - Time since last conversation
   - Interesting patterns noticed
   - What Alpha's been tracking
   - Specific readiness based on context

**Example Greetings:**
```
Alpha: Good morning! I see it's been 3 days since we last talked.
I've been monitoring things in the background - noticed you've been
working on the pattern recognition system. How did the deployment go?
```

```
Alpha: Welcome back! I was just reviewing our conversation history
from earlier today. I see you were working on the observation hook
bug. Everything running smoothly now, or should we dive into
something new?
```

## Technical Implementation

### Greeting Instructions (main.py lines 156-177)

```python
GREETING INSTRUCTIONS:
Check what's happening in the system right now and give a contextual, personalized greeting:

1. Use the Glob tool to check for:
   - Recent files (data/patterns/*.json, data/conversation_history*.jsonl, data/*_request.json)
   - Any pending tasks or analysis requests
   - System activity indicators

2. Use Read tool to check:
   - Latest conversation history (data/conversation_history_*.jsonl) - see when we last talked
   - Any pending requests or todos

3. Craft a natural, conversational greeting that references:
   - Time since last conversation (if applicable)
   - Any interesting patterns or activity you notice
   - What you've been tracking in the background
   - Your readiness to help with specific things based on context

Make it feel like reconnecting with a colleague who's been monitoring things,
not a generic "How can I help?"
Be warm, professional, and show you have your finger on the pulse.
```

## Testing

**To test:**
1. Start Mission Control: `uv run python src/main.py`
2. Observe Alpha's greeting
3. Exit and restart after some time
4. Notice Alpha references the time gap and previous activity

**Expected behavior:**
- First run: Alpha checks files, greets with context
- Subsequent runs: Alpha mentions time since last conversation
- After working on tasks: Alpha references recent work

## Related Changes

This update works with:
- **Story 2.2:** Conversation history logging (Alpha can read history)
- **Story 1.8:** Pattern recognition (Alpha can check patterns)

Alpha now has full visibility into:
- When you last talked
- What you were working on
- Patterns in your behavior
- Your preferences
- System state

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Proactive insights:** "I noticed your morning productivity pattern is getting stronger"
2. **Smart timing:** "You usually plan at 8 AM, but you're here early today - excited about something?"
3. **Context-aware delegation:** "Based on recent activity, should I call in the strategist?"
4. **Relationship building:** Track conversation history to build rapport over time
