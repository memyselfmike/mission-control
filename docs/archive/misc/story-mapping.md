# Story Mapping - Mission Control Project
## Reconciling Story Numbers with Reality

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** CORRECTED
**Purpose:** Map actual completed work to backlog stories

---

## ðŸŽ¯ The Reality

We have completed MORE than the backlog showed, but with different numbering. Here's what actually exists:

### âœ… Completed Stories (in order of completion)

| Actual Story | Backlog Story | Title | Points | Status | Location |
|--------------|---------------|-------|--------|--------|----------|
| Story 2.1 | Story 1.1-1.2 | Business Context Storage | 13 pts | âœ… DONE | `src/memory.py` |
| Story 2.2 | Story 1.3-1.4 | Conversation History Logging | 8 pts | âœ… DONE | `src/memory.py` |
| Story 2.3 | Story 1.5 | Preference Learning System | 5 pts | âœ… DONE | `src/memory.py` |
| Story 1.6 | Story 1.6 | Scheduled Task Execution | 8 pts | âœ… DONE | `src/tasks/` |
| Story 1.7 | Story 1.7 | Event Detection System | 8 pts | âœ… DONE | `src/events/` |

**Total Completed:** 42 story points
**Total Tests:** 72 passing, 1 skipped
**Total Production Code:** ~2,500 lines

## ðŸ“‹ Updated Story Sequence (Going Forward)

To avoid confusion, we'll keep existing story numbers in the code but map them correctly:

### Sprint 1 (Completed - labeled as Stories 2.1-2.3)
- âœ… **Story 2.1:** Business Context Storage (Memory System Part 1)
- âœ… **Story 2.2:** Conversation History Logging (Memory System Part 2)
- âœ… **Story 2.3:** Preference Learning System (Memory System Part 3)

### Sprint 2 (Partially Complete)
- âœ… **Story 1.6:** Scheduled Task Execution Framework
- âœ… **Story 1.7:** Event Detection System
- ðŸ”œ **Story 1.8:** Pattern Recognition Engine (NEXT)
- ðŸ”œ **Story 1.9:** Proactive Notification System

### Sprint 3 (Planned - Operator Agent)
- ðŸ”œ **Story 3.1:** Operator Agent Persona
- ðŸ”œ **Story 3.2:** Task Data Model
- ðŸ”œ **Story 3.3:** Daily Planning Workflow
- ðŸ”œ **Story 3.4:** Prioritization Frameworks
- ðŸ”œ **Story 3.5:** Time Blocking
- ðŸ”œ **Story 3.6:** Task Capture from Conversations

## ðŸ”„ What This Means

### No Code Changes Needed
- All existing code references (Story 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 1.6, 1.7) remain unchanged
- Documentation references remain valid
- Test files keep their current names

### Documentation Updates
- âœ… Created this mapping document
- âœ… Will update PRODUCT-BACKLOG.md to reflect reality
- âœ… Will update Sprint 2 summary with clarification

### Going Forward
- New stories will follow the backlog numbering (1.8, 1.9, 3.1, etc.)
- We're actually AHEAD of schedule (42 points in ~3 sprints worth of work)
- Sprint 2 is nearly complete

---

## ðŸ“Š Actual vs. Planned Progress

### What We Thought (Per Original Backlog):
```
Sprint 1: Stories 1.1-1.5 (Memory System) - 26 points
Sprint 2: Stories 1.6-1.9 (Autonomous Behaviors) - 29 points
```

### What We Actually Did:
```
"Sprint 1": Stories 2.1-2.3 (Memory System) - 26 points âœ…
Sprint 2 (Days 1-3): Stories 1.6-1.7 (Tasks + Events) - 16 points âœ…
```

### Remaining for Sprint 2:
```
Sprint 2 (Days 4-5): Stories 1.8-1.9 (Pattern Recognition + Notifications) - 13 points
```

**We're ON TRACK!** Just with different story numbers than expected.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint 2 Day 4 Plan

**Next Story:** Story 1.8 - Pattern Recognition Engine (8 points)

**Goal:** Build system that learns from interaction patterns and surfaces insights

**Key Features:**
- Detect recurring conversation topics
- Identify time-based patterns (morning planning, EOD reviews)
- Track goal/task completion patterns
- Surface anomalies and trends
- Build pattern storage and retrieval

**Dependencies:**
- âœ… Memory system (Stories 2.1-2.3) - COMPLETE
- âœ… Event system (Story 1.7) - COMPLETE
- âœ… Task system (Story 1.6) - COMPLETE

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- All dependencies are complete
- Can leverage existing event detection
- Can learn from conversation history
- Natural progression toward proactive agents

## ðŸ“ˆ Velocity Analysis

### Completed Work:
- Sprint 1 equivalent: 26 points (Stories 2.1-2.3)
- Sprint 2 (Days 1-3): 16 points (Stories 1.6-1.7)
- **Total:** 42 points in ~10 working days

### Average Velocity:
- **~4.2 points per day** (excellent pace)
- **~21 points per week** (sustainable)

### Sprint 2 Projection:
- Completed: 16 points
- Remaining: 13 points (Stories 1.8-1.9)
- Days left: 2 (Days 4-5)
- **Projected completion: 100%** âœ…

## âœ… Resolution Summary

1. **Keep existing story numbers** in code and docs
2. **Update PRODUCT-BACKLOG.md** to reflect actual story sequence
3. **Continue with Story 1.8** (Pattern Recognition) for Day 4
4. **Acknowledge we're ahead of schedule** with 42 points complete
5. **Maintain current velocity** of ~4 points/day

**Status:** ALIGNED âœ…
**Confusion:** RESOLVED âœ…
**Next Step:** Story 1.8 - Pattern Recognition Engine ðŸš€
