## Sprint 2 Goal

**Primary Goal:**
Enable agents to act autonomously - scheduling tasks, detecting events, recognizing patterns, and notifying users proactively.

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] At least 1 autonomous behavior works end-to-end
- [ ] Task scheduler executes reliably
- [ ] Events detected and trigger actions
- [ ] Patterns recognized from conversation history
- [ ] Test suite expanded to 50+ tests

---

## Day 1 Plan

### Story 1.6: Scheduled Task Execution Framework (8 pts)

**Today's Focus:** Architecture design and test setup

#### Tasks for Day 1
1. **Design task scheduler architecture**
   - Choose scheduling library (schedule vs APScheduler)
   - Define task data model
   - Design task registry/executor pattern

2. **Write tests first (test-driven development)**
   - Test: Register a task
   - Test: Execute task at scheduled time
   - Test: Handle task failure
   - Test: Log task execution

3. **Create basic data structures**
   - Task definition schema
   - Task registry storage
   - Execution log format

4. **Implement task registration**
   - API to register scheduled tasks
   - Store tasks in JSON
   - Validate task definitions

**Expected Output by EOD:**
- Architecture design documented
- 5-8 tests written (TDD approach)
- Basic task registration working
- Data model defined

---

## Technical Approach

### Story 1.6 Technical Details

**Scheduling Library Decision:**
Use Python `schedule` library for MVP
- ✅ Simple and lightweight
- ✅ Good for basic cron-style scheduling
- ✅ Easy to test
- ⚠️ Limited to in-process scheduling
- 💡 Can upgrade to APScheduler later if needed

**Task Data Model:**
```python
{
  "id": "daily_briefing_9am",
  "name": "Daily Briefing",
  "schedule": "09:00",  # Daily at 9am
  "handler": "handlers.daily_briefing",
  "enabled": true,
  "created": "2025-10-16T...",
  "last_run": "2025-10-16T09:00:00Z",
  "next_run": "2025-10-17T09:00:00Z"
}
```

**Architecture Pattern:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Task Scheduler (scheduler.py)       │
│ • Loads tasks from JSON              │
│ • Runs scheduling loop               │
│ • Executes tasks at scheduled times  │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Task Registry (task_registry.py)    │
│ • Register/unregister tasks          │
│ • Store task definitions             │
│ • Validate task schemas              │
└────────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Task Handlers (handlers/*.py)       │
│ • daily_briefing()                   │
│ • weekly_review()                    │
│ • goal_reminder()                    │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Development Guidelines for Sprint 2

### Test-First Approach ✅
**Always write tests before implementation**

Example workflow:
```python
# 1. Write the test (it will fail)
def test_register_task():
    task = {
        "id": "test_task",
        "schedule": "10:00",
        "handler": "handlers.test"
    }
    result = register_task(task)
    assert result == True

    # Verify task was stored
    tasks = load_tasks()
    assert "test_task" in [t["id"] for t in tasks]

# 2. Run test (fails - function doesn't exist)
# 3. Implement function
def register_task(task_def):
    # Implementation here
    pass

# 4. Run test again (passes)
# 5. Refactor if needed
```

### Code Quality Standards
- ✅ All functions have docstrings
- ✅ Type hints for parameters and returns
- ✅ Error handling (try/except with logging)
- ✅ Unit tests for each function (5-10 tests per story)
- ✅ Integration tests for workflows

### Documentation Requirements
- ✅ Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- ✅ API documentation for public functions
- ✅ Usage examples
- ✅ Update README with new capabilities
