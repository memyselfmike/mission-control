## Sprint Highlights

### What Went Well ‚úÖ

1. **User-Driven Architecture Improvement**
   - User correctly identified that direct API calls were wrong
   - Pivoted to Task-based delegation mid-sprint
   - Result: Cleaner, more maintainable architecture

2. **Rapid Bug Fix**
   - Import error caught by user
   - Fixed immediately with test coverage
   - Added 9 import validation tests to prevent regression

3. **Automated Testing**
   - User suggested automation instead of manual testing
   - Created 14 E2E tests in under 1 hour
   - Enables fast feedback loop and CI/CD

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
   - Every story documented
   - Architecture decisions recorded
   - QA reports and test plans created

5. **Positive User Feedback**
   - "I think this most recent story has been implemented really well"
   - User engaged throughout sprint
   - Collaborative problem-solving

### What Could Be Improved üîÑ

1. **Testing Strategy**
   - Should have written tests before implementation
   - Caught bug only when user tested manually
   - **Action:** Adopt test-first approach in Sprint 2

2. **Story Estimation**
   - Story 2.3 underestimated (8 pts ‚Üí 13 pts)
   - Didn't account for V2 redesign complexity
   - **Action:** Add buffer for uncertain stories

3. **End-to-End Validation**
   - Handed off code without running the application
   - User found import error immediately
   - **Action:** Run smoke tests before handoff

4. **Documentation Sprawl**
   - 10+ documents created, hard to navigate
   - Need master index
   - **Action:** Create documentation hub in Sprint 2

---

## Technical Debt

### Created This Sprint
1. **Tier 3 Not Fully Implemented** - Placeholder only (acceptable for MVP)
2. **No Prompt Caching Yet** - Planned for later sprint
3. **Single User Only** - No multi-user support (out of scope)
4. **V2 Test Suite Incomplete** - Only 23 tests, need 50+

### Resolved This Sprint
1. ‚úÖ V1 preference detection (archived, replaced with V2)
2. ‚úÖ Direct API calls (replaced with Task delegation)
3. ‚úÖ Import errors (fixed with test coverage)

---

## Risks & Issues

### Resolved ‚úÖ
1. **Import Error in main.py** - Fixed same day
2. **UTF-8 Encoding Issues** - Fixed in test scripts
3. **Architecture Concerns** - User feedback led to better design

### Ongoing ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Alex Delegation Not Fully Validated** - Manual testing recommended but not blocking
2. **No CI/CD Pipeline** - Tests exist but not automated in GitHub Actions
3. **Performance Not Benchmarked** - Need baseline measurements

### Mitigated üëç
1. **API Key Dependency** - Eliminated with Task delegation
2. **Test Coverage** - 23 automated tests added
3. **Documentation** - Comprehensive docs created
