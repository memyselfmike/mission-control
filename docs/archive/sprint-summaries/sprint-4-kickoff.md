- **Sprint 2:** 29 points (5 days) = 5.8 pts/day
- **Sprint 3:** 22 points (1 day) = 22 pts/day (unsustainable!)

### Sprint 4 Capacity
- **Planned:** 26 points over 5 days = **5.2 pts/day**
- **Conservative estimate** based on Sprint 1-2 velocity
- **Realistic and achievable** with consistent effort

### Stretch Goals (If Ahead of Schedule)

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Task Management Complexity
**Impact:** Medium
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Start simple (JSON files), enhance later if needed

### Risk 2: Workflow User Experience
**Impact:** High (if workflows feel clunky)
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:** Frequent testing with Mike, iterate on feedback

### Risk 3: Integration with Existing Systems
**Impact:** Medium
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:** EPIC-1 & EPIC-2 provide solid foundation, use existing patterns

### Risk 4: Scope Creep
**Impact:** Medium
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Strict DoD enforcement, defer nice-to-haves to Sprint 5
