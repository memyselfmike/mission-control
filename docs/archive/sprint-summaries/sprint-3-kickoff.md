User: "I need to finish the quarterly report, review the budget,
       and prepare for tomorrow's meeting"

Taylor: "Got it. Let me help prioritize:
1. 🔥 Quarterly report (HIGH - due today, 2h)
2. 📊 Budget review (MEDIUM - 1h)
3. 📋 Meeting prep (MEDIUM - 30min)

I suggest:
- 9:00-11:00: Deep work on quarterly report
