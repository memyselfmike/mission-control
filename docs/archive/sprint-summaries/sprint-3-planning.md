# Sprint 3 Planning - Foundation Completion

**Date:** October 17, 2025 (Post-Sprint 2 Retrospective)
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 - Complete EPIC-1 & EPIC-2
**Sprint Dates:** TBD (5 days, awaiting Mike's approval)
**Scrum Master:** Bob
**Product Owner:** Mike
**Team:** Claude Code Development

---

## Sprint Goal

**"Complete the foundation by finishing EPIC-1 (Autonomous Agent Framework) and EPIC-2 (Persistent Memory System) before starting higher-level agent EPICs."**

---

## Context

### User Decision (Mike)

Mike explicitly chose **Option C**: "finish epics 1 and 2, then move on to 3" instead of:
- Option A: Start EPIC-3 (Operator Agent)
- Option B: Start EPIC-4 (Planner Agent)

**Rationale:** Don't leave unfinished work behind. Complete the foundation 100% before building higher-level capabilities.

### Current Status

**EPIC-1: Autonomous Agent Framework**
- Target: 40-50 points total
- Completed: 29 points (Sprint 2 - Stories 1.6, 1.7, 1.8)
- Remaining: ~11-21 points needed

**EPIC-2: Persistent Memory System**
- Target: 25 points total
- Completed: 16 points (Sprint 1 - Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3)
- Remaining: 9 points (Stories 2.4, 2.5)

**Note:** Sprint 0 completed initial EPIC-1 work (Stories 1.1-1.5, 31 points). Sprint 2 added autonomous behaviors to EPIC-1 (Stories 1.6-1.8, 24 points). Story 1.9 (5 points) was deferred from Sprint 2.

---

## Sprint Capacity

**Historical Velocity:** 5-6 points/day (excellent, sustained over Sprint 2)

**Sprint 3 Capacity:**
- 5 days × 5.5 pts/day avg = 27.5 points
- With 0.5 day buffer = **24-28 point capacity**

**Sprint 2 Lessons Applied:**
- Include 0.5 day buffer for unplanned work
- Daily 5-minute check-ins
- Real-time backlog updates
- Clear story numbering convention

---

## Proposed Stories

### EPIC-1: Autonomous Agent Framework (Remaining Work)

#### Story 1.9: Context Gathering (CARRY-OVER) ✅ Already Implemented
**Points:** 5
**Status:** DEFERRED from Sprint 2, but **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED**
**Priority:** P1

**Note:** Upon review, Story 1.9 was actually completed in Sprint 2 but marked as "deferred" in documentation. Implementation exists in `src/memory.py` (lines 1093-1500) with test coverage. Need to verify tests and mark as complete.

**Tasks:**
1. Run existing tests: `test_context_gathering.py`
2. Verify all acceptance criteria met
3. Mark story as complete in all docs
4. Update PRODUCT-BACKLOG.md

**Estimated Time:** 0.5 day (verification only)

---

#### Story 1.10: Proactive Notification System
**Points:** 8
**Status:** NEW
**Priority:** P1

**User Story:**
As a user, I want Mission Control to proactively notify me of important events without having to ask, so that I stay informed of critical developments without manual checking.

**Description:**
Build notification system that surfaces insights, alerts, and recommendations proactively based on:
- Pattern detection (Story 1.8 patterns)
- Event detection (Story 1.7 events)
- Memory analysis (Story 2.3 preferences)
- Time-based triggers (Story 1.6 scheduler)

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 1.6: Scheduled Task Execution ✅
- Story 1.7: Event Detection System ✅
- Story 1.8: Pattern Recognition Engine ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Notification system integrates with event dispatcher (Story 1.7)
2. Notifications triggered by patterns (e.g., "You usually review goals on Fridays")
3. Notifications triggered by events (e.g., "New file in watched directory")
4. Notifications can be scheduled (e.g., "Daily standup at 9am")
5. Notification history logged to `data/memory/notifications.jsonl`
6. Users can configure notification preferences (frequency, types)
7. Notifications displayed in CLI with clear formatting (Rich)
8. Notification delivery is non-blocking (doesn't interrupt conversation)

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: `src/notifications.py`
- Classes: `Notification`, `NotificationManager`, `NotificationDelivery`
- Integration: Hook into event_dispatcher, scheduler, pattern_analyzer
- Storage: `data/memory/notifications.jsonl`
- Configuration: `data/memory/notification_preferences.json`

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 20+ tests covering notification creation, delivery, history
- Integration tests: Trigger notification from pattern, event, schedule
- Test notification preferences (mute, filter by type)
- Test non-blocking delivery during conversation

---

#### Story 1.11: Agent Coordination & Handoff
**Points:** 5
**Status:** NEW
**Priority:** P2

**User Story:**
As the Chief of Staff (Alpha), I want to smoothly coordinate between specialist agents and track delegation history so that complex tasks requiring multiple specialists are handled seamlessly.

**Description:**
Implement agent coordination system that:
- Tracks which specialist is handling which task
- Maintains delegation history
- Enables smooth handoffs between specialists
- Provides context when delegating

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 1.4: Subagent Definitions ✅
- Story 1.9: Context Gathering ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Alpha can delegate task to specialist with explicit context
2. Delegation history logged to `data/memory/delegation_log.jsonl`
3. When task requires multiple specialists, smooth handoff occurs
4. Specialists receive full context from previous specialist
5. User sees clear indication of which specialist is active
6. Delegation patterns tracked (e.g., "Usually delegate metrics to Analyst")
7. System prevents circular delegations (A→B→A loops)

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: `src/coordination.py`
- Classes: `DelegationManager`, `AgentHandoff`, `ContextTransfer`
- Integration: Extend `src/agent_definitions.py` with coordination logic
- Storage: `data/memory/delegation_log.jsonl`

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 15+ tests for delegation tracking, handoff logic
- Integration tests: Multi-specialist workflows (e.g., Planner → Operator)
- Test circular delegation prevention
- Test context transfer completeness

### EPIC-2: Persistent Memory System (Remaining Work)

#### Story 2.4: Memory Loading on Startup
**Points:** 4
**Status:** PLANNED (from epics.md)
**Priority:** P0

**User Story:**
As Alpha (Chief of Staff), I want all memory files loaded automatically on startup so that I have full context from the first conversation turn without requiring explicit commands.

**Description:**
Implement startup sequence that loads all memory files:
- Business context (`data/memory/business_context.json`)
- User preferences (`data/memory/user_preferences.json`)
- Conversation history (last N interactions)
- Goals/Rocks (if they exist)
- Recent patterns

Memory should be injected into Alpha's system prompt before first user message.

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 2.1: Business Context Storage ✅
- Story 2.2: Conversation History Logging ✅
- Story 2.3: Preference Learning System ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. On app startup, `load_all_memory()` function loads all memory files
2. Business context loaded and available in first response
3. User preferences loaded and applied to communication style
4. Last 10 conversation interactions loaded for reference
5. If memory files missing, graceful handling (empty state)
6. Memory loading completes in <2 seconds
7. Memory injected into system prompt with clear sections
8. Loading errors logged but don't prevent startup

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: `src/memory.py` (extend existing)
- Function: `load_all_memory() -> Dict[str, Any]`
- Integration: Call from `main.py` before conversation loop starts
- Format: Structured prompt with sections (Business Context, Preferences, Recent History)

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 12+ tests for memory loading scenarios
- Test with missing files (graceful fallback)
- Test with corrupted files (error handling)
- Performance test: <2 second load time
- Integration test: Verify memory available in first response

---

#### Story 2.5: Memory Pruning Strategy
**Points:** 5
**Status:** PLANNED (from epics.md)
**Priority:** P1

**User Story:**
As a system, I want to automatically prune old or irrelevant memory so that memory files don't grow unbounded and context quality remains high.

**Description:**
Implement retention policies and pruning logic:
- Conversation history: Keep last 90 days, archive older
- Patterns: Keep patterns with confidence >0.3, archive low-confidence
- Preferences: Keep preferences confirmed in last 30 days
- Business context: Manual pruning only (high-value data)

Pruning should be:
- Automatic (scheduled task, daily at 3am)
- Safe (archive before delete)
- Configurable (retention policies in config file)
- Transparent (log what was pruned)

**Prerequisites:**
- Story 2.4: Memory Loading on Startup
- Story 1.6: Scheduled Task Execution ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `prune_memory()` function implements retention policies
2. Conversation history >90 days archived to `data/memory/archive/`
3. Low-confidence patterns (<0.3) archived
4. Preferences not confirmed in 30 days marked as "stale"
5. Pruning logged to `data/memory/pruning_log.jsonl`
6. Retention policies configurable via `data/memory/retention_config.json`
7. Pruning scheduled as daily task (3am)
8. Archive files compressed (gzip) to save space
9. Manual pruning command available: `prune --force --dry-run`

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: `src/memory.py` (extend existing)
- Functions: `prune_memory()`, `archive_old_data()`, `compress_archives()`
- Scheduled Task: Register in `task_registry.py`
- Configuration: `data/memory/retention_config.json`
- Archives: `data/memory/archive/{type}_{date}.json.gz`

**Testing:**
- Unit tests: 15+ tests for pruning logic, retention policies
- Test conversation history pruning (90-day cutoff)
- Test pattern pruning (confidence threshold)
- Test preference staleness marking
- Test archive creation and compression
- Test dry-run mode (no actual deletion)
- Integration test: Scheduled task execution

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Story 1.9 tests may not exist
**Impact:** LOW
**Mitigation:** If tests missing, write tests (add 1-2 days). Story code exists in memory.py.

### Risk 2: Notification system more complex than estimated
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:** Focus on MVP (basic notifications). Defer advanced features to Story 1.12 if needed.

### Risk 3: Memory pruning edge cases
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:** Start with simple retention policies. Add complexity incrementally. Include dry-run mode for safety.
