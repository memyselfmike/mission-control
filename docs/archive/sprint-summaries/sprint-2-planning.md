**Product Owner:** Mike
**Team:** DEV Agent

## Sprint 1 Review Summary

‚úÖ **Sprint 1 COMPLETE** - 26 points delivered
- Foundation built (conversation system, memory, learning)
- All automated tests passing (23/23)
- User feedback positive
- Ready to build autonomous behaviors

---

## Sprint 2 Overview

### Sprint Goal
**Build autonomous agent behaviors with scheduled task execution and event detection**

### Duration
**Estimated:** 1 week (based on 25-35 points/week velocity)

### Target Outcome
Agents can act proactively based on schedules and events, not just respond to user requests.

---

## Proposed Stories

### From EPIC-1: Autonomous Agent Framework (Part 2)

#### STORY-1.6: Build Scheduled Task Execution Framework
**Points:** 8
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)
**Description:** Create framework for agents to execute tasks on schedules (daily, weekly, monthly)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Cron-style scheduler implemented
- [ ] Tasks can be registered with schedules
- [ ] Tasks execute reliably at specified times
- [ ] Failed tasks can be retried
- [ ] Execution logged for audit trail

**Technical Approach:**
- Use `schedule` library or native `asyncio` with timers
- Store task definitions in JSON
- Create task registry and executor
- Add monitoring/logging

**Dependencies:** None (Sprint 1 complete)
**Risk:** Medium (new capability, scheduling can be tricky)

---

#### STORY-1.7: Build Event Detection System
**Points:** 8
**Priority:** P0 (Critical Path)
**Description:** System to detect events in conversations and trigger actions

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Event listeners can be registered
- [ ] Events detected from conversation patterns
- [ ] Events trigger registered handlers
- [ ] Event history logged
- [ ] Multiple handlers per event supported

**Technical Approach:**
- Extend hook system to detect events
- Create event bus/dispatcher pattern
- Define common event types (goal_mentioned, deadline_approaching, etc.)
- Integrate with conversation logging

**Dependencies:** Story 1.6 (for task execution)
**Risk:** Medium (pattern matching complexity)

---

#### STORY-1.8: Implement Pattern Recognition Engine
**Points:** 8
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Description:** Detect behavioral patterns across conversations (timing, topics, mood)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Time-based pattern detection (planning at 9am)
- [ ] Topic pattern detection (frequently discusses X)
- [ ] Trend analysis (increasing/decreasing interest)
- [ ] Patterns stored with confidence scores
- [ ] Patterns influence agent behavior

**Technical Approach:**
- Analyze conversation history for patterns
- Use statistical methods (frequency, timing analysis)
- Store patterns in memory system
- Integrate with preference learning

**Dependencies:** Stories 1.6, 1.7
**Risk:** High (complex analysis, AI may be needed)

---

#### STORY-1.9: Build Proactive Notification System
**Points:** 5
**Priority:** P1 (High)
**Description:** Agents can send notifications/messages to user proactively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Notification queue implemented
- [ ] Notifications can be scheduled
- [ ] Notifications displayed in next session
- [ ] Notifications can be dismissed
- [ ] Priority levels (urgent, normal, low)

**Technical Approach:**
- Create notification data structure
- Store in `data/notifications/` directory
- Display on session start
- Add mark-as-read functionality

**Dependencies:** Story 1.6
**Risk:** Low (straightforward implementation)

---

### Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)

#### STORY-2.1: Create Basic Chief of Staff Agent (Partial)
**Points:** 3 (subset of full 5 pt story)
**Priority:** P2 (Nice to have)
**Description:** Enhance Alex with basic autonomous behaviors

**Scope for Sprint 2:**
- Daily briefing generation (autonomous)
- Morning greeting with context
- Simple task suggestions based on patterns

**Full Story Deferred to:** Sprint 3+

---

## Sprint Capacity

### Sprint 1 Actual Velocity
**26 points** delivered (with estimation variance)

### Sprint 2 Estimated Capacity
**29 points** (stories 1.6-1.9)

**Buffer:** -3 points from stretch goal (Story 2.1 partial)

**Risk Adjustment:**
- If stories 1.6-1.9 take longer than expected, drop Story 2.1
- Focus on completing EPIC-1 Part 2 fully

---

## Technical Considerations

### New Dependencies
- `schedule` library (or similar) for task scheduling
- Possibly `APScheduler` for advanced scheduling
- Event bus pattern implementation

### Testing Strategy
- **Test-first approach** for new stories
- Each story should have 5-10 automated tests
- Integration tests for event ‚Üí action flow
- Performance tests for scheduler

### Documentation Requirements
- Architecture docs for scheduling system
- Event catalog (list of supported events)
- Pattern recognition algorithms explained
- API docs for registering tasks/events

---

## Definition of Done (Sprint Level)

### For Each Story
- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Automated tests written (5-10 per story)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed (self-review with AI assistance)
- [ ] Committed to git

### For Sprint 2
- [ ] All committed stories complete
- [ ] Test suite expanded (50+ total tests)
- [ ] Sprint demo prepared
- [ ] Sprint retrospective completed
- [ ] Backlog groomed for Sprint 3

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Pattern Recognition Complexity
**Impact:** HIGH
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Start with simple pattern detection (time-based)
- Use AI for complex patterns if needed
- Defer advanced patterns to later sprint

### Risk 2: Scheduling Reliability
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Probability:** LOW
**Mitigation:**
- Use proven libraries (schedule, APScheduler)
- Add retry logic and error handling
- Monitor task execution closely

### Risk 3: Scope Creep
**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Probability:** MEDIUM
**Mitigation:**
- Stick to acceptance criteria
- Defer nice-to-haves to later sprints
- Review progress at mid-sprint

---

## Sprint Schedule

### Week 1
**Days 1-2:** Story 1.6 (Scheduled Task Execution)
**Days 3-4:** Story 1.7 (Event Detection)
**Day 5:** Story 1.8 (Pattern Recognition) - Start

### Week 2 (if needed)
**Days 1-2:** Story 1.8 (Pattern Recognition) - Complete
**Day 3:** Story 1.9 (Proactive Notifications)
**Day 4:** Story 2.1 (Partial - stretch goal)
**Day 5:** Testing, documentation, sprint review

---

## Questions for Product Owner

### Story Prioritization
1. **Is EPIC-1 completion (autonomous behaviors) the top priority?**
   - Alternative: Start EPIC-3 (Operator agent) for immediate user value

2. **How sophisticated should pattern recognition be in Sprint 2?**
   - Simple: Just time-based patterns
   - Medium: Time + topic patterns
   - Complex: AI-powered pattern detection

3. **Should we set up CI/CD in Sprint 2?**
   - Adds 5 points but provides long-term value
   - Alternative: Defer to Sprint 3

### Technical Decisions
4. **Scheduling approach preference?**
   - Simple: `schedule` library (easy, limited features)
   - Advanced: `APScheduler` (complex, more features)

5. **Event detection approach?**
   - Rule-based: Pattern matching (fast, limited)
   - AI-powered: Claude Extended Thinking (slower, smarter)

---

## Success Metrics

### Sprint 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] At least 1 autonomous behavior working (daily briefing or reminder)
- [ ] Task scheduler executing reliably
- [ ] Events detected and handled
- [ ] Test suite expanded to 50+ tests
- [ ] User can experience proactive agent behavior

### Demo Preparation
**What to demonstrate:**
1. Task scheduled and executing automatically
2. Event detected and action triggered
3. Pattern recognized and influencing behavior
4. Notification delivered proactively

---

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. Do we want to build autonomous behaviors (EPIC-1) or user-facing features (EPIC-3 Operator) next?
2. How much AI should we use for pattern recognition vs. rule-based?
3. Should we invest in CI/CD setup now or later?
4. What's the priority: more features or more polish/testing?
5. Any new requirements or changes to backlog priorities?

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Sprint 2 as planned?** ‚úÖ YES

**Key Decision Points:**
1. Approve 4 core stories (1.6-1.9) - 29 points
2. Consider stretch goal (Story 2.1 partial) - 3 points
3. Answer prioritization questions
4. Confirm technical approach preferences

**Next Step:** Product Owner (Mike) review and approval
