## Error Handling Validation ✅

### Tested Error Scenarios

1. **Invalid Task Schema** ✅
   - Missing required fields → Rejected with clear error
   - Invalid schedule type → Rejected with error message

2. **Duplicate Task ID** ✅
   - Attempting duplicate registration → Rejected with error
   - Error message: "Task with ID 'X' already exists"

3. **Non-Existent Task** ✅
   - Executing non-existent task → Graceful failure
   - Status: "failure", Error: "Task 'X' not found"

4. **Invalid Handler Path** ✅
   - Loading non-existent handler → Error caught
   - Error: "Failed to load handler X: ..."

5. **Handler Execution Failure** ✅
   - Handler raises exception → Caught and logged
   - Retry logic triggered if configured

**Error Handling Grade:** A ✅

---

## Security Validation

### Security Checks Performed

1. **Handler Path Security** ✅
   - Invalid paths rejected
   - No arbitrary code execution
   - Import errors handled safely

2. **File System Security** ✅
   - Task IDs don't cause directory traversal
   - Files created in designated directories only
   - Proper file permissions (user-only)

3. **Data Validation** ✅
   - Schema validation prevents malformed data
   - Required fields enforced
   - Type checking on schedule configurations

**Security Grade:** B+ (Good for MVP)

**Note:** Enhanced security measures (task ID sanitization, handler whitelist) recommended for v1.0.
