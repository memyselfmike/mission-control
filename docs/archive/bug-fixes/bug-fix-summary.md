# Bug Fix: UnboundLocalError in main.py

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested
**Severity:** Critical (prevented application startup)

---

## The Error

```
Fatal Error: cannot access local variable 'OBSERVATION_HOOK'
where it is not associated with a value
```

**Root Cause:** Duplicate import statement inside a try block that shadowed the module-level import.

---

## What Went Wrong

### Before (Broken):
```python
# Line 34: Module-level import
from preference_hooks import OBSERVATION_HOOK

...

# Line 227: Duplicate import inside try block (WRONG!)
try:
    from preference_hooks import OBSERVATION_HOOK  # ❌ Shadows the module import

    hook_input = {...}
    await OBSERVATION_HOOK(hook_input, None, hook_context)  # ❌ Fails here
```

**Why it failed:**
- Python sees the `from ... import` statement inside the try block
- This creates a local variable `OBSERVATION_HOOK` in that scope
- The local variable is referenced (in `await OBSERVATION_HOOK(...)`) before it's assigned
- Result: `UnboundLocalError`

---

## The Fix

### After (Working):
```python
# Line 34: Module-level import (kept)
from preference_hooks import OBSERVATION_HOOK

...

# Line 227: Removed duplicate import
try:
    # ✅ No import - uses module-level OBSERVATION_HOOK

    hook_input = {...}
    await OBSERVATION_HOOK(hook_input, None, hook_context)  # ✅ Works now
```

**File changed:** `src/main.py` (line 227 removed)

## Lesson Learned

> "You're absolutely right - we should have caught this with unit tests" - User feedback

### What We Did Wrong:
1. ❌ Didn't run the application after making changes
2. ❌ Didn't have import validation tests
3. ❌ Handed off code without basic smoke testing

### What We Did Right:
1. ✅ Created comprehensive import test suite
2. ✅ Fixed the bug immediately
3. ✅ Documented the issue for future reference

---

## Prevention: New Test Suite

Created `tests/test_imports.py` with 9 tests:

1. ✅ `test_preference_hooks_import` - Validates OBSERVATION_HOOK is importable
2. ✅ `test_preference_learning_import` - Validates coordinator functions
3. ✅ `test_agent_definitions_import` - Validates subagent registration
4. ✅ `test_memory_import` - Validates storage functions
5. ✅ `test_main_imports` - Validates main.py can be imported
6. ✅ `test_observation_hook_signature` - Validates async signature
7. ✅ `test_preference_analyzer_in_agents` - Validates subagent config
8. ✅ `test_no_circular_imports` - Validates no circular dependencies
9. ✅ `test_all_hook_dependencies_available` - Validates hook functions work

**All 9 tests pass:** ✅

---

## Verification

1. ✅ Import tests pass (9/9)
2. ✅ `main.py` can be imported without errors
3. ✅ No duplicate imports remain
4. ✅ Module-level imports properly scoped

---

## Going Forward

### Before Handing Off Code:
1. **Run the application** - Basic smoke test
2. **Run all tests** - `pytest tests/ -v`
3. **Test critical paths** - At minimum, verify imports work
4. **Check for obvious errors** - Syntax, undefined variables, etc.

### CI/CD Recommendation:
Add pre-commit hook to run import tests:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
pytest tests/test_imports.py -q
```

---

## Status

✅ **Bug fixed**
✅ **Tests added**
✅ **Documentation created**
✅ **Ready for user testing**

The application should now start correctly and all imports work as expected.
