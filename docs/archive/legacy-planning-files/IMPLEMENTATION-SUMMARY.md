# Implementation Summary
## Mission Control v2.0 - Claude Agent SDK Hybrid

**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Implementation
**Architecture:** Claude Agent SDK + BMAD Method Patterns

---

## Executive Summary

Mission Control v2.0 represents a complete reimagining of the system using the **Claude Agent SDK** as the foundation, combined with **BMAD Method** organizational patterns. This hybrid approach delivers true autonomous agent capabilities while maintaining structured workflows.

### What Changed from v1.0

| Aspect | v1.0 (BMAD-only) | v2.0 (SDK Hybrid) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Technology** | YAML-based BMAD framework | Python + Claude Agent SDK |
| **Agent Behavior** | Reactive (user-triggered workflows) | Autonomous (proactive + reactive) |
| **Memory** | Stateless between sessions | Persistent across sessions |
| **Subagents** | No subagent support | Full subagent spawning via Task tool |
| **Hooks** | Limited to BMAD workflows | Event-driven autonomous behaviors |
| **MCP** | No external tool integration | Full MCP support (Playwright, etc.) |
| **Extensibility** | Manual YAML editing | Programmatic agent creation |

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Claude Agent SDK + BMAD Hybrid?

**Decision:** Use Claude Agent SDK as foundation, adapt BMAD patterns for structure

**Rationale:**
- SDK provides true autonomous capabilities (hooks, subagents, MCP)
- BMAD provides proven workflow patterns and templates
- Hybrid combines strengths of both approaches

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex than pure BMAD (requires Python knowledge)
- More powerful than pure BMAD (enables autonomous behaviors)

### 2. Why Python over YAML?

**Decision:** Python-based implementation using SDK

**Rationale:**
- Programmatic control over agents
- Access to full Python ecosystem
- Better testing and debugging
- More extensible long-term

**Trade-offs:**
- Higher barrier to entry than YAML
- Requires Python 3.13+ environment

### 3. Why Subagent Architecture?

**Decision:** Use Task tool to spawn specialist subagents

**Rationale:**
- Context isolation (subagents don't share state)
- Tool isolation (granular permissions per agent)
- Parallelization (multiple subagents work simultaneously)
- Specialization (expert agents for specific domains)

**Trade-offs:**
- More complex than single-agent approach
- Higher API costs (each subagent is a separate session)

### 4. Why File-based Memory?

**Decision:** Store memory as JSON files in /data folder

**Rationale:**
- Simple and transparent (user can inspect/edit)
- Version control friendly
- No database dependency
- Easy backup and portability

**Trade-offs:**
- Not suitable for extremely large datasets
- Manual file structure management

### 5. Why Hooks over Workflows?

**Decision:** Use event-driven hooks instead of predefined workflows

**Rationale:**
- More flexible and dynamic
- Enables true autonomous behaviors
- Easier to add new behaviors
- No workflow state management needed

**Trade-offs:**
- Hooks are harder to visualize
- Debugging is more complex

## Critical Success Factors

### For Development Team

1. **Follow the Stories**: EPIC-1 stories provide step-by-step implementation path
2. **Test Incrementally**: Test each story before moving to next
3. **Use Examples**: Reference claude-agent-sdk-intro repo for patterns
4. **Document Changes**: Update docs as you discover improvements
5. **Start Simple**: Get basic version working before adding complexity

### For Users

1. **Clear Business Context**: Populate data/memory/business_context.json thoroughly
2. **Set Goals**: Create goal files for tracking
3. **Give Feedback**: Agent personas improve with user feedback
4. **Use Consistently**: Memory improves with regular use
5. **Trust Delegation**: Let Chief of Staff delegate to specialists

- Hooks execute successfully
- Memory files load/save correctly
- Templates render properly

### Integration Tests
- Chief of Staff can spawn subagents
- Subagents complete tasks
- Hooks trigger on correct events
- MCP tools work

### End-to-End Tests
- Full conversation flows
- Daily planning workflow
- Quarterly planning workflow
- Research project workflow

### User Acceptance Tests
- Non-technical user can interact naturally
- Delegation feels seamless
- Proactive insights are valuable
- Memory persistence works across sessions

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **API costs higher than expected** | High | Medium | Use Haiku for testing, Sonnet for production; implement token tracking |
| **Hooks cause performance issues** | Medium | Low | Optimize slow hooks; implement async execution |
| **Memory files grow too large** | Medium | Medium | Implement archival/cleanup; summarize old data |
| **Users find subagents confusing** | High | Low | Clear Chief of Staff explanations; smooth handoffs |
| **Agent personas don't match expectations** | High | Medium | Iterate on output styles based on feedback |
