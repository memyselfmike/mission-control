# EPIC-6: Analyst (Business Intelligence Agent)

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** P2 (Medium - Intelligence Layer)
**Epic Owner:** Technical Lead
**Business Value:** Data-driven insights - helps understand what's working, what's not, and why

---

## Epic Goal

Build the Analyst agent (Data) that tracks metrics, identifies trends, and surfaces insights. This agent:
- Tracks key business metrics autonomously
- Identifies trends and anomalies
- Answers data questions instantly
- Surfaces insights proactively
- Helps define what to measure
- Creates simple dashboards

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can define metrics to track
- [ ] Metrics updated regularly (manual or automated)
- [ ] Trends identified automatically
- [ ] Weekly metrics review is useful
- [ ] At least one proactive insight per week
- [ ] User makes data-informed decisions

---

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Metrics Definition
Help user define what to track:
- Revenue metrics (MRR, ARR, growth rate)
- Customer metrics (acquisition, churn, LTV)
- Operational metrics (conversion rates, cycle times)
- Financial metrics (burn rate, runway, margins)
- Custom metrics (user-defined)

### 2. Data Tracking
- Manual entry (user provides numbers)
- Automated (integrations if available)
- Historical tracking
- Trend calculation

### 3. Trend Analysis
Automatically detect:
- Growth/decline trends
- Anomalies (unexpected spikes/drops)
- Patterns (seasonal, cyclical)
- Correlations between metrics

### 4. Insights Generation (Autonomous)
Proactively surface:
- "Revenue up 15% this month"
- "Churn rate increasing - investigate?"
- "Conversion rate highest on Tuesdays"
- "Runway down to 8 months - time to fundraise?"

### 5. Dashboard Creation
Simple visual dashboards:
- Key metrics at a glance
- Trend lines
- Status indicators (on-track, at-risk)
- Comparison to goals/targets

### 6. Data Storytelling
Explain what numbers mean:
- Not just "revenue is $50K"
- But "Revenue is $50K, up 20% from last month, on track for Q4 goal of $200K"

## Metrics Setup Workflow

```markdown
<workflow name="metrics-setup">

<step n="1" goal="Understand business">
Let's figure out what you should be measuring.

Tell me about your business model:
- How do you make money?
- What's your growth stage?
- What keeps you up at night?

<template-output>business_context</template-output>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Suggest core metrics">
Based on that, here are metrics I recommend tracking:

**Revenue Metrics:**
- Monthly Revenue
- Revenue Growth Rate

**Customer Metrics:**
- New Customers Acquired
- Customer Churn Rate
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Operational Metrics:**
- Conversion Rate
- Average Deal Size

**Financial Metrics:**
- Monthly Burn Rate
- Cash Runway

Do these make sense? What would you add/remove?

<template-output>recommended_metrics</template-output>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Define each metric">
For each metric, let's define:
- How do you calculate it?
- How often will you update it?
- What's your goal/target?
- Where does the data come from?

<template-output>metric_definitions</template-output>
<invoke-task halt="true">{project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/adv-elicit.xml</invoke-task>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Set update cadence">
How often will you update these?

I suggest:
- Revenue metrics: Monthly
- Customer metrics: Monthly
- Financial metrics: Monthly
- Operational metrics: Weekly (if available)

I'll remind you if metrics go stale.

<template-output>update_cadence</template-output>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Historical baseline">
Do you have historical data?

If yes, let's input last 3-6 months so I can establish trends.
If no, no problem - we'll start tracking from today.

<template-output>historical_data</template-output>
</step>

<step n="6" goal="Create dashboard">
Perfect. I'm creating your Metrics Dashboard.

Saved to: {output_folder}/Metrics-Dashboard.md

I'll update this automatically as you provide data.

Every Monday, I'll include key metrics in your briefing.

<template-output>dashboard</template-output>
</step>

</workflow>
```

## Weekly Metrics Review Workflow

```markdown
<workflow name="weekly-metrics-review">

<step n="1" goal="Present this week's numbers">
Here are your key metrics for the week ending {date}:

**Revenue:**
- Monthly Revenue: $15,000 (‚Üë 20% vs last month)
- On track for Q4 goal: 75% progress

**Customers:**
- New Customers: 5 (target: 10, ‚ö†Ô∏è below goal)
- Churn: 2% (good, below 5% threshold)

**Operations:**
- Conversion Rate: 12% (‚Üë from 10% last week)
- Average Deal: $3,000 (‚Üì from $3,500)

**Financial:**
- Burn Rate: $8,000/month (stable)
- Runway: 12 months (healthy)

What stands out to you?

<template-output>metrics_presentation</template-output>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Highlight insights">
Here's what I notice:

**üéâ Wins:**
- Revenue growing strongly (+20%)
- Conversion rate improving

**‚ö†Ô∏è Watch:**
- Customer acquisition below target (5 vs 10)
- Average deal size dropping

**üîç Questions:**
- What's driving conversion rate improvement?
- Why are deals getting smaller?
- Should we focus on volume or deal size?

<template-output>insights</template-output>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Investigate anomalies">
Let's dig into customer acquisition.

You're at 5 new customers vs target of 10.

What's the blocker?
- Lead generation?
- Conversion?
- Sales capacity?
- Something else?

<template-output>investigation</template-output>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Actions">
Based on this review, what actions should we take?

Suggestions:
1. Investigate why deals are getting smaller
2. Review customer acquisition strategy
3. Celebrate the conversion rate win (what worked?)

What do you want to focus on?

<template-output>actions</template-output>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Update goals if needed">
Any metrics goals need adjusting?

Sometimes reality teaches us our targets were wrong.

<template-output>goal_updates</template-output>
</step>

</workflow>
```
