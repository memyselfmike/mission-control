# EPIC-2: Chief of Staff (Orchestrator Agent)

**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** P0 (Critical - Primary Interface)
**Epic Owner:** Product Lead
**Business Value:** Single point of contact for user - the agent that knows everything and coordinates everyone

- Serves as the main conversation partner
- Routes to specialist agents intelligently
- Maintains complete business context
- Generates daily briefings autonomously
- Surfaces proactive insights
- Coordinates actions across all agents

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can have natural conversations with Chief of Staff
- [ ] Agent routes to specialists based on intent detection
- [ ] Context maintained across all conversations
- [ ] Daily briefings generated automatically at 6:30 AM
- [ ] Agent proactively surfaces important items
- [ ] Seamless handoffs to/from specialist agents

---

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Intent Detection & Routing
Understands user requests and routes to appropriate specialist:

```
"Let's plan Q1" â†’ Routes to Planner
"Should we pursue this opportunity?" â†’ Routes to Strategist
"I'm overwhelmed today" â†’ Routes to Operator
"What's our revenue trend?" â†’ Routes to Analyst
"Let's chat about vision" â†’ Routes to Strategist
```

### 2. Context Management
Maintains complete picture of:
- Active goals/projects
- Recent decisions
- Upcoming deadlines
- Current priorities
- Team status
- Business metrics

### 3. Daily Briefing (Autonomous)
Every morning at 6:30 AM, generates:
- Top 3 priorities for today
- Schedule overview with gaps for deep work
- Heads up on important items
- Proactive questions/challenges

### 4. Proactive Intelligence
Surfaces insights without being asked:
- "You've mentioned X 3 times - should we address it?"
- "Goal Y is at risk - only 2 weeks left"
- "You haven't reviewed metrics in 10 days"
- "3 opportunities sitting in backlog"

### 5. End of Day Reflection
At EOD (or when user signals), facilitates:
- What got done today
- What didn't (and why)
- New insights/learnings
- Tomorrow's top 3
- One reflection question

### 6. Weekly Review (Fridays 4pm)
Automatically prepares:
- Progress on goals this week
- Wins and challenges
- Patterns noticed
- Prep for next week

## Technical Architecture

### Agent Definition
```yaml
agent:
  metadata:
    id: "bmad/mission-control/agents/chief-of-staff.md"
    name: "Alex"
    title: "Chief of Staff"
    icon: "ðŸŽ¯"
    type: "orchestrator"

  autonomous_capabilities:
    scheduled_tasks: [daily-briefing, weekly-review, monthly-prompt]
    event_monitors: [goal-risk, pattern-detection, deadline-alert]
    learning: [communication-style, decision-patterns, productivity-times]

  routing_rules:
    - intent: ["plan", "goal", "quarterly", "project"]
      route_to: "planner"
    - intent: ["strategy", "vision", "opportunity", "market"]
      route_to: "strategist"
    - intent: ["today", "tasks", "priorities", "overwhelmed"]
      route_to: "operator"
    - intent: ["metrics", "revenue", "data", "trend"]
      route_to: "analyst"
```

---

## Dependencies

- EPIC-1 (Autonomous Agent Framework) - **MUST COMPLETE FIRST**
- Module structure created
- Memory system operational

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Intent detection fails, routes to wrong agent
**Mitigation:** Fallback to asking clarifying question

**Risk:** Daily briefings become ignored/annoying
**Mitigation:** User configurable (time, length, what's included)

**Risk:** Agent doesn't have enough context to be useful
**Mitigation:** Aggressive context capture, user can enrich
