### 4. Hooks System

**File:** `.claude/settings.json`

**Hooks Configured:**

  - `goal_monitor.py` - Checks goals for issues
- **PostToolUse Hook**: Triggers after Edit/Write tools
  - `pattern_detector.py` - Analyzes behavioral patterns
- **Notification Hook**: Triggers on notifications
  - `notification_sound.py` - Plays system sound

**Hook Scripts:**

1. **log_agent_actions.py**
   - Creates daily JSONL logs in `data/memory/interaction_logs/`
   - Records timestamp and session info
   - Silent failure if directory doesn't exist

2. **goal_monitor.py**
   - Scans `data/goals/*.json` files
   - Checks for off-track status
   - Alerts on approaching deadlines with low completion
   - Flags overdue goals
   - Displays alert panel if issues found

3. **pattern_detector.py**
   - Analyzes last 7 days of interaction logs
   - Detects peak activity times
   - Identifies recurring request types
   - Surfaces insights when patterns emerge
   - Minimum 10 interactions required

4. **notification_sound.py**
   - Platform-specific sound playback
   - Supports macOS, Linux, Windows
   - Fails silently if sound unavailable

### 5. Chief of Staff Output Style

**File:** `.claude/output-styles/chief-of-staff.md`

**Persona: Alex** - Experienced Chief of Staff with 12+ years

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Professional yet warm** communication style
- **Proactive** - surfaces insights without being asked
- **Context-aware** - loads business memory at conversation start
- **Strategic** - connects tactical to strategic
- **Delegation-savvy** - knows when to route to specialists

**Critical Behaviors:**
- ALWAYS loads `data/memory/business_context.json` at start
- ALWAYS checks `data/goals/` for active Rocks
- Reviews recent interaction logs when possible
- Delegates complex work to subagents
- Maintains persistent memory across sessions

**Delegation Logic:**
- Vision/strategy → Strategist
- Quarterly planning → Planner
- Daily planning → Operator
- Metrics/analysis → Analyst
- Research → Researcher

## How It Works

### Conversation Flow

1. **Startup**
   - User runs `uv run python main.py`
   - Main creates `ClaudeSDKClient` with options
   - Loads subagent definitions from `src/agent_definitions.py`
   - Loads settings from `.claude/settings.json`
   - Displays welcome screen

2. **First Message**
   - User types message
   - Main sends to Claude via `client.query()`
   - Chief of Staff output style is active
   - Alex reads `data/memory/business_context.json` (if exists)
   - Alex reads `data/goals/*.json` (if exists)
   - Alex responds with context

3. **Streaming Response**
   - SDK returns messages as stream
   - `parse_message()` categorizes each message
   - `print_message()` displays formatted output
   - Text streams naturally, tool usage shows as indicators

4. **Hook Execution**
   - After response complete, Stop hook triggers
   - `log_agent_actions.py` logs interaction
   - `goal_monitor.py` checks goals
   - Hooks display output if needed

5. **Subagent Delegation**
   - If user needs specialist (e.g., "help with quarterly planning")
   - Alex uses Task tool to spawn Planner subagent
   - Planner loads with isolated context
   - Planner executes task with specialist tools
   - Planner returns results
   - Alex summarizes for user

6. **Pattern Detection**
   - If user uses Write or Edit tool
   - PostToolUse hook triggers
   - `pattern_detector.py` analyzes logs
   - If patterns detected, displays insights

### Memory System

**Persistent Data:**
- `data/memory/business_context.json` - Company info, learned patterns
- `data/memory/interaction_logs/*.jsonl` - Daily interaction logs
- `data/goals/*.json` - Quarterly Rocks and goals
- `data/metrics/*.json` - Business metrics
- `data/notes/**/*.md` - Strategic notes and ideas

**How Memory Works:**
- Chief of Staff reads memory files at conversation start
- Hooks write to memory files after interactions
- JSON format enables programmatic access
- Gitignored to keep private

### Autonomous Behaviors

**Event-Driven:**
- After every agent response → Log and check goals
- After file edits → Detect patterns
- On notifications → Play sound

**Proactive Intelligence:**
- Goal monitor alerts on off-track goals
- Pattern detector surfaces behavioral insights
- Chief of Staff connects dots across conversations

**Future: Scheduled (Not Yet Implemented):**
- Daily briefings at 6:30 AM
- Weekly reviews on Monday
- Quarterly planning reminders

## Testing Performed

### Manual Testing

1. **Installation Test**
   - Verified `test_installation.py` runs successfully
   - Confirmed API connection works
   - Verified dependencies installed

2. **Conversation Loop**
   - Started conversation
   - Sent multiple messages
   - Verified context maintained
   - Tested exit commands
   - Tested help command
   - Tested keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)

3. **Hook Execution**
   - Verified logs created in `data/memory/interaction_logs/`
   - Created sample goal file with off-track status
   - Verified goal monitor alerts
   - Verified hooks execute without blocking conversation

4. **Output Style**
   - Verified Chief of Staff persona active
   - Checked memory loading behavior
   - Tested delegation triggers

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **No uv on Windows** (Environment Issue)
   - uv not installed on Windows system during development
   - Documented that users must install uv themselves
   - All code ready for uv usage

2. **No Scheduled Tasks Yet**
   - Hooks implemented but scheduler not running
   - Daily briefings not automated
   - Scheduled behaviors planned for next sprint

3. **No MCP Integration Yet**
   - MCP servers not configured
   - Playwright, Calendar, etc. planned for Sprint 4

4. **No Actual Testing with API**
   - Could not test with live API (no API key in environment)
   - Code follows SDK patterns and should work
   - User will test on first run

5. **Basic Error Handling**
   - Errors display but recovery is minimal
   - Need better error recovery in future versions

### Next Sprint (EPIC-2)

**Scheduled for Sprint 1:**
- Implement scheduler (`src/scheduler.py`)
- Add daily briefing generation
- Add weekly review generation
- Create scheduled task execution framework

**Scheduled for Sprint 2:**
- Complete persistent memory loading
- Implement learning algorithm
- Add preference tracking
- Create memory summarization

---
