## What's Working

### ✅ Core Functionality

1. **Conversation System**
   - Alex responds professionally
   - Subagent delegation works (Task tool)
   - Rich console formatting with panels and markdown
   - Session tracking with UUIDs

2. **Memory System**
   - Business context captured and loaded
   - User preferences stored (V1 format working)
   - Conversation history in JSONL (daily files)
   - All data persists in `/data` directory

3. **Preference Learning (V2)**
   - Tier 1: Real-time observation hooks (<1ms)
   - Tier 2: Request-based coordination (creates request files)
   - Tier 3: Placeholder for long-term meta-analysis
   - preference_analyzer subagent registered

4. **Subagent Architecture**
   - 6 specialists defined (including preference_analyzer)
   - Alex knows when to delegate
   - System prompt includes delegation rules
   - Clean separation of concerns

## What Needs QA Validation

### 🔍 Critical Path Testing

1. **Preference Analyzer Delegation (NOT YET TESTED END-TO-END)**
   - ⏳ Request file creation works ✅
   - ⏳ Alex detection of request file (needs validation)
   - ⏳ Task delegation to preference_analyzer (needs validation)
   - ⏳ V2 JSON output generation (needs validation)
   - ⏳ Request file cleanup (needs validation)

   **How to Test:**
   - Chat with Alex for 10+ messages about preferences
   - Exit and restart Mission Control
   - Alex should detect request and delegate
   - Verify `data/user_preferences_v2.json` created

2. **Subagent Delegation (Partially Tested)**
   - ✅ Task tool available
   - ✅ Agents registered in options
   - ⏳ Alex actually delegates to specialists (needs more testing)
   - ⏳ Specialist responses integrated (needs validation)

3. **Memory Persistence (Working but needs edge case testing)**
   - ✅ Data files created correctly
   - ✅ Data loads on startup
   - ⏳ Large conversation histories (performance)
   - ⏳ Corrupted file handling
   - ⏳ Concurrent access (multiple sessions)

---

### 🔍 Edge Cases to Test

1. **Empty State Testing**
   - ⏳ First run with no data files
   - ⏳ Missing directories (should auto-create)
   - ⏳ Empty conversation history

2. **Error Handling**
   - ✅ Import errors (caught with tests)
   - ⏳ Network failures (Claude API down)
   - ⏳ Invalid JSON in data files
   - ⏳ Hook execution failures

3. **Long-Running Sessions**
   - ⏳ Multiple back-to-back sessions
   - ⏳ Very long conversations (100+ turns)
   - ⏳ Memory usage over time

4. **Windows-Specific Issues**
   - ✅ UTF-8 encoding fixed
   - ✅ File path handling (Windows backslashes)
   - ⏳ Console width/wrapping

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### 🐛 Known Bugs
- ✅ **FIXED:** Import error in main.py (duplicate import)
- ✅ **FIXED:** UTF-8 encoding in test scripts

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Preference Learning V2 - Not Fully Validated**
   - System creates request files ✅
   - Alex delegation to preference_analyzer **not yet tested end-to-end**
   - V2 JSON output generation **not yet validated**
   - User reports: "I think this most recent story has been implemented really well" (positive but not fully validated)

2. **Tier 3 Meta-Analysis - Placeholder Only**
   - Coordinator implemented
   - Actual long-term analysis logic not implemented
   - Acceptable for MVP

3. **No Prompt Caching Yet**
   - Will add 90% cost reduction
   - Planned for Phase 2

4. **Single User Only**
   - No multi-user profile support
   - Out of scope for MVP

5. **No Calendar Integration**
   - Can't schedule tasks or check availability
   - Planned for later sprint

6. **Limited Error Recovery**
   - Silent failures in hooks (by design)
   - Could be more robust

## Risks & Concerns

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Preference Analyzer End-to-End Flow Not Validated**
   - Risk: Core feature may not work as expected
   - Mitigation: Needs immediate QA testing
   - Impact: High (Story 2.3 V2 may need adjustments)

2. **No Comprehensive Test Suite for V2**
   - Risk: Regressions not caught early
   - Mitigation: Create full test suite (32+ tests like V1)
   - Impact: Medium (manual testing can catch most issues)

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

3. **Performance Not Measured**
   - Risk: Slow execution with large histories
   - Mitigation: Add performance benchmarks
   - Impact: Medium (MVP can be slower)

4. **No CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Risk: Manual testing only
   - Mitigation: Add pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions
   - Impact: Medium (manageable with discipline)

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

5. **Documentation Sprawl**
   - Risk: Too many docs, hard to navigate
   - Mitigation: Create documentation index
   - Impact: Low (docs are comprehensive)

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Sprint 2)

1. **✅ QA VALIDATION REQUIRED**
   - User test: Full preference learning flow (10+ messages)
   - Verify Alex detects and delegates to preference_analyzer
   - Validate V2 JSON output quality
   - Test with different preference types

2. **Create V2 Test Suite**
   - Port relevant V1 tests to V2
   - Add Task delegation tests
   - Add hook integration tests
   - Target: 20+ tests covering main paths

3. **Performance Baseline**
   - Measure Tier 1 hook execution time (target: <200ms)
   - Measure conversation history load time
   - Set performance budgets

4. **Documentation Cleanup**
   - Create master index of all docs
   - Archive obsolete docs to `/docs/archive/`
   - Create quick-start guide

### Before Production

5. **Security Review**
   - Validate data file permissions
   - Check for sensitive data in logs
   - Review error messages (no info leakage)

6. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Add graceful degradation for network failures
   - Better error messages for users
   - Retry logic for transient failures

7. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Add structured logging
   - Track hook execution metrics
   - Monitor memory usage
