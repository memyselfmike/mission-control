# Mission Control Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Author:** Mike
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Project Level:** 4 (Enterprise scale)
**Project Type:** CLI Tool (Hybrid: BMAD Method + Claude Agent SDK)
**Target Scale:** 40+ stories, 5+ epics, multi-phase platform evolution

---

## Description, Context and Goals

### Project Description

Mission Control is an **autonomous AI-powered executive team** delivered as an interactive Python CLI application. Unlike traditional chatbots that merely respond to queries, Mission Control works proactively—monitoring goals, surfacing insights, and orchestrating specialist agents to handle complex work autonomously.

Built on a hybrid architecture combining the **Claude Agent SDK** (for autonomous behaviors, subagent spawning, and MCP integration) with **BMAD Method patterns** (for workflow structure and organizational wisdom), Mission Control serves as a persistent executive assistant that maintains context across sessions, learns preferences, and operates on schedules and events.

**Core Value Proposition:** An AI system that works FOR you (proactive, autonomous) rather than just responding TO you (reactive, manual).

**Primary User:** Entrepreneurs, CEOs, and business leaders who need structured accountability, strategic thinking support, and intelligent task orchestration without the overhead of hiring a full executive team.

### Deployment Intent

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Production-ready CLI tool for individual power users
- Self-hosted Python application
- Local data storage (privacy-first)
- Claude API integration
- Basic autonomous behaviors (hooks, scheduled tasks)
- 5 core specialist subagents
- Rich-formatted terminal interface

**Phase 2 (Platform):** Extensible agent ecosystem
- Custom agent marketplace
- Advanced MCP integrations (calendar, email, metrics APIs)
- Workflow automation system
- Pattern recognition and proactive insights
- Multi-modal interfaces (web dashboard, mobile companion)

**Phase 3 (Enterprise):** Team collaboration platform
- Multi-user support with shared context
- Team agent delegation
- Role-based access control
- Centralized analytics and insights
- SaaS offering with managed infrastructure

### Context

**Problem Space:**

Modern entrepreneurs and business leaders face a critical challenge: they need executive-level support for strategic planning, goal tracking, business intelligence, and daily execution—but cannot afford or justify hiring a full C-suite team early in their journey. Traditional productivity tools are passive (require manual input) and fragmented (no unified context). AI chatbots like ChatGPT/Claude are reactive (must be prompted) and stateless (lose context between sessions).

**Current Situation:**

- Leaders use a fragmented stack: Notion for notes, spreadsheets for metrics, calendar apps for scheduling, separate tools for planning
- Context switching is expensive and error-prone
- No proactive intelligence—insights require manual analysis
- Strategic thinking happens ad-hoc without structure
- Goal tracking relies on manual reviews rather than automated monitoring

**Why Now:**

1. **Claude Agent SDK** (released 2025) enables truly autonomous AI agents with persistent memory and proactive behaviors
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** allows seamless integration with external tools and data sources
3. **BMAD Method** provides proven workflow patterns for structured business thinking
4. **Economic pressure** drives demand for AI-augmented productivity over human hiring
5. **Python 3.13+** async/await patterns make building complex agent systems practical

**Strategic Opportunity:**

Be the first to market with a genuinely autonomous executive team that combines:
- Persistent memory (learns your business over time)
- Proactive intelligence (surfaces insights without prompting)
- Specialist expertise (delegates to domain-specific agents)
- Workflow automation (structured processes, not just chat)
- Privacy-first architecture (data stays local)

### Goals

Mission Control aims to achieve the following strategic outcomes:

1. **Autonomous Operation** - System proactively monitors goals, surfaces insights, and executes scheduled tasks without manual prompting (measured by % of value delivered proactively vs. reactively)

2. **Context Persistence** - Maintain comprehensive business context across sessions, learning user preferences and business patterns (measured by context retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction scores)

3. **Specialist Delegation** - Successfully route complex work to appropriate specialist agents with minimal user intervention (measured by delegation success rate and task completion quality)

4. **Workflow Automation** - Reduce time spent on routine planning, tracking, and analysis by 60% through automated workflows (measured by user time logs pre/post adoption)

5. **Proactive Intelligence** - Surface 5+ actionable insights per week based on goal progress, metric trends, and pattern recognition (measured by insight acceptance rate and business impact)

6. **Extensibility** - Enable users to add custom agents, workflows, and integrations without code changes (measured by community-created extensions and adoption rate)

7. **Privacy Assurance** - Guarantee data sovereignty with 100% local storage and transparent API usage (measured by security audits and user trust metrics)

## UX Design Principles

The following principles guide all interface and interaction design decisions for Mission Control:

**UP-1: Proactive, Not Reactive**
The system should surface insights, reminders, and actions without being prompted. Default to working FOR the user, not just responding TO the user.

**UP-2: Context Continuity**
Every interaction should feel like continuing a conversation with someone who knows your business. Never ask for information the system should already know.

**UP-3: Specialist Clarity**
Users should always know which agent they're talking to and why that agent is the right expert for the current task. Transitions should be explicit: "I'm bringing in Quinn (Planner) who specializes in goal setting..."

**UP-4: Progressive Disclosure**
Start simple (natural conversation) but make power features discoverable. New users shouldn't be overwhelmed; power users should find depth.

**UP-5: Trust Through Transparency**
Always explain reasoning behind recommendations. Show data sources. Make it easy to verify claims. Build trust through openness, not black-box magic.

**UP-6: Respectful Interruption**
When operating autonomously (scheduled briefings, alerts), be helpful but not annoying. Allow snooze/dismiss. Learn preferred notification times.

**UP-7: Beautiful Terminal Experience**
Even in a CLI, interactions should feel polished. Use Rich formatting for tables, progress bars, syntax highlighting. Make data scannable.

**UP-8: Error Elegance**
Errors should be helpful, not cryptic. Suggest fixes. Provide recovery options. Never blame the user.

**UP-9: Privacy Visibility**
Make data storage transparent. Users should easily see what's stored, where, and why. Make export/delete trivial.

**UP-10: Memory That Matters**
Don't just remember everything—remember what's useful. Surface relevant context proactively. Prune outdated information. Quality over quantity.

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial MVP release (Phase 1) but preserved for future consideration:

**Multi-User Support**
- Team collaboration features
- Shared business context
- Role-based access control
*Rationale:* Focus on individual power users first. Multi-tenancy adds significant complexity.
*Future Phase:* Phase 3 (Enterprise)

**Web Dashboard**
- Browser-based interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Real-time sync with CLI
*Rationale:* CLI-first keeps scope manageable. Web UI is nice-to-have, not must-have.
*Future Phase:* Phase 2 (Platform)

**Mobile Application**
- iOS/Android companion apps
- Push notifications
- Offline sync
*Rationale:* CLI-first philosophy. Mobile adds entire additional platform.
*Future Phase:* Phase 2 (Platform)

**Voice Interface**
- Speech-to-text input
- Text-to-speech responses
- Voice commands
*Rationale:* Multimodal interaction is complex. Text-first is proven.
*Future Phase:* Phase 4+ (Advanced Features)

**Advanced Analytics**
- Machine learning on business data
- Predictive forecasting
- Anomaly detection algorithms
*Rationale:* Pattern recognition is enough for MVP. ML requires training data and time.
*Future Phase:* Phase 3 (Enterprise)

**Third-Party Marketplace**
- Custom agent marketplace
- Paid extension ecosystem
- Community workflows
*Rationale:* Need critical mass of users first before marketplace makes sense.
*Future Phase:* Phase 2 (Platform)

**Video/Screen Recording**
- Screen capture for context
- Meeting recording and transcription
- Video analysis
*Rationale:* Privacy concerns. Adds significant complexity. Not core value prop.
*Future Phase:* TBD

**Social Features**
- Share insights publicly
- Leaderboards/gamification
- Social comparison
*Rationale:* Runs counter to privacy-first philosophy. Not aligned with target user.
*Future Phase:* Never (philosophical misalignment)
