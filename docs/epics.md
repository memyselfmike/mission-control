# Mission Control - Epic Breakdown

**Author:** Mike
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Project Level:** 4 (Enterprise scale)
**Target Scale:** 40+ stories across 7 epics, ~218 story points

---

## Epic Overview

Mission Control's development is organized into 7 major epics, each delivering significant incremental value. The epics are sequenced to establish foundation first (agent system, memory), then build productivity features (goals, automation), and finally extend capabilities (intelligence, integrations).

**Delivery Phases:**

- **Phase 1 (Sprint 0-4):** EPICs 1-2 - Foundation (agents + memory) - 56 points
- **Phase 2 (Sprint 5-9):** EPICs 3-4 - Core productivity (goals + automation) - 62 points
- **Phase 3 (Sprint 10-14):** EPICs 5-6 - Intelligence (workflows + metrics) - 62 points
- **Phase 4 (Sprint 15-20):** EPIC 7 - Advanced integrations - 38 points

**Priority Rationale:**
1. Can't build features without working agent system (EPIC-1 first)
2. Persistent memory enables all other features (EPIC-2 second)
3. Goal tracking and automation are core value props (EPICs 3-4)
4. Workflows and metrics enhance productivity (EPICs 5-6)
5. Advanced integrations are powerful but not MVP-critical (EPIC-7)

## EPIC-1: Autonomous Agent Framework Foundation

**Priority:** P0 (Must Have - MVP Blocker)
**Story Points:** 31
**Sprint Allocation:** Sprints 0-2
**Status:** In Progress

### Epic Goal

Establish the foundational agent system using Claude Agent SDK, enabling users to have continuous conversations with a Chief of Staff agent that can delegate work to 5 specialist subagents, each with isolated contexts and autonomous behaviors triggered by hooks.

### Capabilities Delivered

- Chief of Staff (Alex) as primary conversational interface
- 5 specialist subagents: Strategist, Planner, Operator, Analyst, Researcher
- AgentDefinition-based subagent spawning with context transfer
- Continuous conversation loop with Rich CLI formatting
- Basic hooks system (Stop, PostToolUse, Notification)
- Agent persona definitions via output styles

### Success Criteria

- [ ] User can have multi-turn conversation with Chief of Staff without crashes
- [ ] Chief of Staff successfully delegates to all 5 specialists with appropriate context
- [ ] Subagents complete tasks in isolated contexts without cross-contamination
- [ ] Conversation history persists across multiple turns within single session
- [ ] Hooks trigger correctly on events without application crashes
- [ ] Rich CLI formatting displays agent responses clearly with visual distinction

### Technical Architecture Notes

- Uses Claude Agent SDK `AgentDefinition` for subagent specifications
- Main loop in `main.py` using `ClaudeSDKClient`
- Subagent definitions in `src/agent_definitions.py`
- Output styles in `.claude/output-styles/` for persona customization
- Hooks in `.claude/hooks/` as Python scripts
- Rich library for terminal formatting

### Dependencies

- Python 3.13+
- Claude Agent SDK >=0.1.0
- Rich >=13.0.0
- Anthropic API key or Claude Code authentication

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** SDK version compatibility issues
**Mitigation:** Lock SDK version in pyproject.toml, test with specific SDK release

**Risk:** Hook execution failures crash main loop
**Mitigation:** Wrap hook execution in try/except, log errors, continue conversation

**Risk:** Context transfer between agents loses information
**Mitigation:** Explicit context handoff testing, validate transferred data
