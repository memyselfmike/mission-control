# Mission Control - Epic Breakdown

**Author:** Mike
**Date:** 2025-10-20 (Updated post-architectural review)
**Project Level:** 4 (Enterprise scale)
**Target Scale:** 48+ stories across 8 epics, ~318-388 story points

---

## Epic Overview

Mission Control's development is organized into 8 major epics (including EPIC-5R architectural refactoring), each delivering significant incremental value. The epic sequence was adjusted after Sprint 4 to prioritize architectural quality before continuing feature development.

**Delivery Phases:**

- **Phase 1 (Sprints 0-4):** EPICs 1-2 - Foundation (agents + memory) - 56 points ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 2 (Sprint 4):** EPIC-3 Part 1 - Operator Agent (daily execution) - 26 points ✅ COMPLETE
- **Phase 3 (Sprints 5-10):** EPIC-5R - Architectural Refactoring - 83 points 🔄 NEXT
- **Phase 4 (Sprints 11-13):** EPIC-3 Part 2 + EPIC-4 - Operator completion + Planner - 39-59 points
- **Phase 5 (Sprints 14-17):** EPICs 5-6 - Strategist + Analyst - 55-75 points
- **Phase 6 (Sprints 18-22):** EPIC-7 - Agent Designer (self-extending) - 30-40 points

**Priority Rationale:**
1. Can't build features without working agent system (EPIC-1 first)
2. Persistent memory enables all other features (EPIC-2 second)
3. Daily execution delivers immediate user value (EPIC-3 Part 1)
4. **Clean architecture accelerates all future development (EPIC-5R critical pivot)**
5. Complete operator and add planner (EPIC-3 Part 2, EPIC-4)
6. Strategic thinking and intelligence (EPICs 5-6)
7. Self-extending system enables user customization (EPIC-7)

## EPIC-5R: Architectural Refactoring (CRITICAL PIVOT)

**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL - Blocks all future development)
**Story Points:** 83
**Sprint Allocation:** Sprints 5-10 (6 weeks)
**Status:** 📋 Next

### Epic Goal

Refactor Mission Control codebase from procedural functions on dictionaries to proper Hexagonal/Clean Architecture with OOP, repository pattern, and SOLID principles. Establish clean foundation that accelerates all future development (EPIC-3 Part 2, EPIC-4, 5, 6, 7).

### Context

Architectural debt identified during Sprint 5 planning (2025-10-20). Current implementation works but uses patterns that don't scale:
- God object: memory.py (1,500 lines, 4 concerns)
- Anemic domain model: Tasks/workflows as Dict[str, Any]
- Flat structure: No domain/application/infrastructure separation
- Tight coupling: Direct file I/O, no repository pattern
- Type safety gaps: Excessive Dict[str, Any] usage

### Capabilities Delivered

- Hexagonal/Clean Architecture with strict layer boundaries
- Domain entities with behavior (Task.mark_complete() not mark_task_complete(task))
- Repository pattern for ALL storage (enables easy testing, future DB migration)
- SOLID principles throughout
- Type safety with proper domain types (Priority enum, Status enum)
- 90%+ domain test coverage, 80%+ integration coverage
- CLAUDE.md engineering standards (for future AI self-coding)

### Success Criteria

- [x] CLAUDE.md created with mandatory engineering standards (1,006 lines)
- [ ] All 282+ existing tests still passing
- [ ] New domain layer: 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] New integration tests: 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Strangler Fig migration: Zero downtime, gradual rollout
- [ ] Performance: No degradation from current baseline
- [ ] Architecture validation: Clean dependency flow

### Refactoring Phases (6 weeks, 83 points)

**Phase 1: Foundation (10 pts, Week 1)**
- Story 5.1: Create Domain Value Objects (3 pts)
- Story 5.2: Create Task Entity (5 pts)
- Story 5.3: Create Repository Interfaces (2 pts)

**Phase 2: Infrastructure (16 pts, Week 2)**
- Story 5.4: Create JSON Storage Utility (3 pts)
- Story 5.5: Implement Task Repository (5 pts)
- Story 5.6: Implement Memory Repositories (8 pts) - Split memory.py

**Phase 3: Application Services (18 pts, Week 3)**
- Story 6.1: Task Management Use Cases (5 pts)
- Story 6.2: Planning Services (8 pts)
- Story 6.3: Domain Services (5 pts)

**Phase 4: Presentation Layer (8 pts, Week 4)**
- Story 6.4: Create Formatters (3 pts)
- Story 6.5: Refactor CLI Entry Point (5 pts)

**Phase 5: Events & Coordination (18 pts, Week 5)**
- Story 7.1: Refactor Event System (8 pts)
- Story 7.2: Refactor Notification System (5 pts)
- Story 7.3: Refactor Coordination (5 pts)

**Phase 6: Testing & Documentation (13 pts, Week 6)**
- Story 8.1: Unit Tests for Domain Layer (5 pts)
- Story 8.2: Integration Tests for Repositories (5 pts)
- Story 8.3: Architecture Documentation (3 pts)

### Migration Strategy

**Pattern:** Strangler Fig (build new alongside old, gradual migration)

**Approach:**
- Build new layered architecture in parallel with existing code
- Feature flags control which implementation is active
- Migrate functionality incrementally
- Comprehensive tests ensure no regressions
- Remove old code once new validated
- **Checkpoint after Phase 2 (Week 3)** to assess and adjust

### Post-Refactoring Benefits

- EPIC-3 Part 2: Stories 3.6+ significantly easier
- EPIC-4+: Faster implementation, more maintainable, better tested, more extensible
- Self-Coding Ready: CLAUDE.md enables Mission Control to code itself
