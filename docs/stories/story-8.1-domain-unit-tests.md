# Story 8.1: Unit Tests for Domain Layer

Status: Done
Completed: 2025-10-25
Sprint: 5 (EPIC-5R - Phase 6: Testing & Documentation)

## Story

As a **Developer**,
I want **comprehensive unit tests for all domain layer components**,
so that **we achieve 90%+ test coverage and can refactor confidently**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC1**: Value objects have 100% test coverage (Priority, Status, EnergyLevel, Context, TimeBlock)
2. **AC2**: Task entity has 100% test coverage (all 18 fields, 9 behavior methods, 3 factory methods)
3. **AC3**: Domain services have 90%+ test coverage (TaskPrioritizationService, EnergyMatchingService, TimeBlockingService)
4. **AC4**: Domain events have 90%+ test coverage (BaseEvent, TaskEvents)
5. **AC5**: Domain models have 90%+ test coverage (Notification model)
6. **AC6**: Integration tests verify domain services working together (at least 20 new tests)
7. **AC7**: All tests follow CLAUDE.md standards (AAA pattern, descriptive names, isolated, fast <10ms each)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Layer:** Domain (Pure business logic, zero dependencies on infrastructure)
**Pattern:** Hexagonal/Clean Architecture
**Testing Philosophy:** Fast, isolated unit tests. Integration tests for service composition.

### Current Test Coverage (Baseline)

From existing stories:
- Story 5.1: 30 tests for value objects (Priority, Status, EnergyLevel, Context, TimeBlock)
- Story 5.2: 44 tests for Task entity
- Story 5.3: 25 tests for repository interfaces
- Story 6.3: Tests for domain services (TaskPrioritizationService, EnergyMatchingService, TimeBlockingService)

**Current Coverage:** ~75-80% estimated
**Target Coverage:** 90%+ for domain layer

### Testing Standards (CLAUDE.md)

All tests must follow:
1. **AAA Pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert (clear sections)
2. **Descriptive Names**: test_method_scenario__expected_behavior
3. **Isolation**: No shared state, no test interdependencies
4. **Performance**: Each test <10ms (domain tests should be microseconds)
5. **Coverage**: Use pytest-cov to measure and report

### Test Organization

```
tests/domain/
├── entities/
│   └── test_task.py (existing, enhance)
├── value_objects/
│   └── test_value_objects.py (existing, enhance)
├── services/
│   └── test_domain_services.py (existing, enhance)
├── events/
│   └── test_domain_events.py (new)
├── models/
│   └── test_notification.py (new)
└── integration/
    └── test_domain_integration.py (new - 20+ tests)
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment**: Follows Hexagonal Architecture (ADR-009)
- Domain layer is pure Python (no external dependencies except stdlib)
- No infrastructure imports (no file I/O, no database, no network)
- All dependencies injected via interfaces (repository pattern)

**Testing Approach**:
- Unit tests use mocks for repository interfaces
- Integration tests use in-memory repositories (when available)
- Focus on behavior, not implementation
