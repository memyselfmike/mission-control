Project Mission Control: Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Version: 1.1

Date: 14 October 2025

Author: Gemini (in collaboration with User)

Status: Draft

1. Goals and Background Context
1.1. Goals
This project aims to develop an AI-powered executive team, codenamed MissionControl, designed to install and run a robust business operating system for a CEO/entrepreneur.

Primary Goal: To create a system that provides strategic clarity, facilitates disciplined planning, and drives daily execution, enabling the user to function as a high-leverage Visionary.

Secondary Goals:

Integrate the proven methodologies of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) into a suite of AI-driven tools.

Establish a core team of specialized AI agents (Strategist, Planner, Operator) augmented by an expert EOS Implementer.

Develop a framework for designing and building new "AI employee" agents to fill seats on a dynamic Accountability Chart.

Provide a seamless, conversational interface for all executive functions, from long-term strategy to daily task management.

1.2. Background Context
The user seeks to adapt the agent-based BMad-Method framework from software development to the domain of executive management. The current challenge is translating high-level business goals into consistent, day-to-day action. Existing productivity tools are often disconnected from the strategic vision.

Project Mission Control solves this by creating a cohesive team of AI agents that not only assist with tasks but actively install and run a complete business operating system. The integration of EOS provides a battle-tested framework, while the BMad structure provides the mechanism for the AI agents to execute it. This system will act as a trusted, always-on executive team.

2. Requirements
2.1. Functional Requirements (FR)
ID	Requirement
FR1	The system shall provide a core team of four specialist agents: Chief of Staff (Orchestrator), Strategist, Planner, and Operator.
FR2	The system shall include a specialist eos-implementer agent responsible for facilitating all EOS processes and tools.
FR3	The system must be capable of facilitating the creation, maintenance, and review of a Vision/Traction Organizer™ (V/TO™).
FR4	The system must support the setting of quarterly company priorities (Rocks) and tracking their completion status.
FR5	The system must be able to facilitate a weekly Level 10 Meeting™, following the official agenda, including an IDS™ session.
FR6	The system must guide the user in building and reviewing a weekly Scorecard of key business metrics.
FR7	The system must provide a workflow for designing new AI agents by defining an Accountability Chart and using an "Agent Analyzer" based on the GWC™ model (Get it, Want it, Capacity).
FR8	The system must support daily task prioritization using the Eisenhower Matrix and daily scheduling using Time Blocking.

2.2. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
ID	Requirement
NFR1	Modularity: All agents, tasks, templates, and workflows must be defined in separate, human-readable markdown and YAML files for easy customization and maintenance within the MissionControl bundle.
NFR2	Extensibility: The MissionControl bundle must be structured to allow for the seamless addition of new agents, tasks, and workflows without modifying the core system.
NFR3	Usability: The primary user interaction shall be conversational, guided by the exec-orchestrator agent, who will recommend and hand off to specialist agents as needed.
NFR4	Consistency: All documents generated by the system (e.g., V/TO, Scorecard, Meeting Minutes) must adhere to predefined, structured templates.
NFR5	Framework Compliance: All components must be built to the specifications of the underlying BMad-Method framework to ensure portability and compatibility.

3. Agent Interaction & Experience Goals
Overall Vision: The experience should feel like having a world-class, deeply integrated executive team and a professional business coach on call 24/7. It should reduce cognitive load for the user, instill discipline, and create momentum.

Core Interaction Paradigms: The system will be conversational and command-driven. The exec-orchestrator acts as a natural language gateway, interpreting the user's needs and activating the appropriate agent or workflow.

Key Workflows (The "User Journeys"):

EOS Installation: A guided, one-time setup to build the company's foundational operating documents.

Quarterly Pulsing: A recurring, structured session to review performance and set the next 90-day priorities.

Weekly L10 Meeting: The core, disciplined weekly rhythm to maintain traction.

Daily Focus: A quick, daily startup routine to prioritize and plan the day's work.

New Agent Design: An on-demand workflow to define and create a specification for a new AI agent to delegate a business function to.

4. Technical Assumptions
Core Framework: The entire system will be built as a bundle for the BMAD-Method framework.

Bundle Name: The root directory for all components will be named MissionControl.

Repository Structure: The project will be organized as a monorepo under the MissionControl/ directory, containing subdirectories for agents/, tasks/, templates/, data/, and workflows/.

Technology Stack: All components will be defined using Markdown and YAML, with no other programming languages required for the core definitions.

Testing & Validation: Each component's functionality will be validated through practical, use-case-driven testing within the Gemini environment.

5. Epic and Story Structure
The development of Project Mission Control will be organized into the following epics. Each epic represents a major deliverable of system functionality.

Epic 1: Foundational Agents & Core System

Goal: To create the core personas and foundational structure of the executive team.

Epic 2: EOS Tooling Implementation

Goal: To build the core tasks and templates that enable the eos-implementer to facilitate key EOS processes.

Epic 3: AI Workforce Design Module

Goal: To implement the workflow that allows the user to design new AI agents based on the Accountability Chart.

Epic 4: Workflow Integration & Orchestration

Goal: To define the high-level workflows that tie all agents and tasks together into cohesive executive processes.

6. Detailed Epic Example: Epic 2 - EOS Tooling Implementation
Epic Goal: To build the core tasks and document templates that enable the eos-implementer to facilitate the foundational processes of the Entrepreneurial Operating System.

Story 2.1: V/TO Facilitation

As a User, I want to be guided through the 8 questions of the Vision/Traction Organizer, so that I can establish a clear, documented vision for my business.

Acceptance Criteria:

The eos-implementer agent must ask all 8 V/TO questions sequentially, explaining the purpose of each.

The user's answers for each of the 8 sections must be accurately captured.

Upon completion, a final V/TO document must be generated from the vto-output-tmpl.yaml template.

Story 2.2: L10 Meeting Facilitation

As a User, I want to run a structured weekly Level 10 meeting guided by an AI facilitator, so that I can maintain team traction and solve issues effectively.

Acceptance Criteria:

The eos-implementer agent must follow the 7-step Level 10 Meeting agenda in the correct order.

The agent must prompt for Scorecard numbers, Rock status, and To-Do list review.

The agent must facilitate an IDS session on the user's prioritized issues.

At the end of the meeting, a summary document with minutes and a new to-do list must be generated from the l10-meeting-minutes-tmpl.yaml.
