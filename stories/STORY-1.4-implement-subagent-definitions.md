# STORY-1.4: Implement Subagent Definitions

**Epic:** EPIC-1 - Autonomous Agent Framework
**Status:** Not Started
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Story Points:** 8
**Assignee:** TBD

---

## User Story

As a **developer**
I want to **define specialized subagent configurations**
So that **the main agent can delegate work to expert specialists**

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AgentDefinition configs created for all 5 core subagents
- [ ] Each subagent has clear description and prompt
- [ ] Tool permissions configured appropriately per agent
- [ ] Subagents can be spawned via Task tool
- [ ] Main agent can successfully delegate to subagents
- [ ] Subagents maintain isolated contexts
- [ ] Subagents execute tasks and return results
- [ ] All subagents tested individually

---

## Technical Details

### Core Subagents to Implement

1. **Strategist** - Long-term vision and strategic clarity
2. **Planner** - Quarterly planning and goal tracking
3. **Operator** - Daily execution and productivity
4. **Analyst** - Business intelligence and metrics
5. **Researcher** - Deep research and documentation

### Implementation: src/agent_definitions.py

```python
"""
Agent Definitions for Mission Control Subagents

Each subagent is defined with:
- description: What the agent does (shown to main agent for routing)
- prompt: System prompt defining agent behavior and capabilities
- model: Which Claude model to use
- tools: List of allowed tools for this agent
"""

# Helper function to list available agents
def list_agents() -> list[str]:

```

### Integration with main.py

Update main.py to load agent definitions:

```python
from src.agent_definitions import agents

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    permission_mode="acceptEdits",
    setting_sources=["project"],
    allowed_tools=[
        'Read', 'Write', 'Edit', 'MultiEdit',
        'Grep', 'Glob',
        'Task',  # Required for subagents
        'TodoWrite',
        'WebSearch', 'WebFetch',
    ],
    agents=agents  # Add subagent definitions
)
```

### Testing Subagents

Each subagent should be tested individually:

```python
# test_subagents.py

import asyncio
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeSDKClient, ClaudeAgentOptions
from src.agent_definitions import agents

async def test_subagent(agent_name: str, test_prompt: str):
    """Test a specific subagent"""
    print(f"\n{'='*60}")
    print(f"Testing: {agent_name}")
    print(f"{'='*60}\n")

    options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
        model="claude-haiku-4-20250611",  # Use Haiku for testing
        agents={agent_name: agents[agent_name]}
    )

    async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
        # Spawn the subagent
        await client.query(f"""
        Please spawn the '{agent_name}' subagent with the following task:
        {test_prompt}
        """)

        async for message in client.receive_response():
            if message.get("type") == "content_block_delta":
                print(message["text"], end="")

        print("\n")


async def run_tests():
    """Run tests for all subagents"""

    tests = [
        ("strategist", "Help me draft a 10-year vision statement for a SaaS company"),
        ("planner", "Create a template for quarterly Rock planning"),
        ("operator", "Create a sample daily plan using the Eisenhower Matrix"),
        ("analyst", "Design a simple business scorecard template"),
        ("researcher", "Research the top 3 AI agent frameworks (brief summary)"),
    ]

    for agent_name, prompt in tests:
        await test_subagent(agent_name, prompt)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(run_tests())
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 5 subagent definitions implemented in src/agent_definitions.py
- [ ] Each agent has comprehensive prompt with capabilities, approach, tools, and deliverables
- [ ] Agent dictionary exported for use in main.py
- [ ] main.py updated to load agent definitions
- [ ] Test script created and all agents tested
- [ ] Documentation added to each agent definition
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 style
- [ ] All agents successfully spawn and complete test tasks

---

## Testing Steps

1. **Code Validation**
   ```bash
   python -c "from src.agent_definitions import agents; print(len(agents))"
   # Should output: 5
   ```

2. **Agent Loading Test**
   ```bash
   python -c "from src.agent_definitions import agents, list_agents; print(list_agents())"
   # Should output: ['strategist', 'planner', 'operator', 'analyst', 'researcher']
   ```

3. **Run Subagent Tests**
   ```bash
   python test_subagents.py
   ```
   - Verify each agent spawns successfully
   - Verify each agent responds appropriately
   - Verify no errors

4. **Manual Integration Test**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   - Ask: "I need help with quarterly planning"
   - Verify agent delegates to planner subagent
   - Ask: "Can you research the AI agent market?"
   - Verify agent delegates to researcher subagent

## Dependencies

- STORY-1.1 (SDK installation)
- STORY-1.2 (Project structure)
- STORY-1.3 (Basic conversation loop)

---

## Notes

- Agent prompts are critical - they define agent behavior
- Tool permissions should follow principle of least privilege
- Each agent should have clear, specific domain expertise
- Subagents run in isolated contexts (don't share state)
- Reference: claude-agent-sdk-intro/6_subagents.py for patterns
