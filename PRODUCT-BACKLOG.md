## Story Point Estimates

| Points | Complexity | Time Estimate | Examples |
|--------|------------|---------------|----------|
| 1-2 | Trivial | 1-2 hours | Config file, simple template |
| 3-5 | Small | Half day | Simple workflow, agent persona |
| 5-8 | Medium | 1 day | Complete workflow, data model |
| 8-13 | Large | 2-3 days | Complex workflow, routing system |
| 13-21 | Very Large | 3-5 days | Orchestration, learning algorithm |

---

## Velocity Assumptions

**Assumed Velocity:** 25-35 points per week (single developer, full-time)

**Actual sprints:** 14 sprints × ~30 points avg = ~420 points planned
**With buffer:** Matches 225-295 point estimate across 7 epics

**Timeline:**
- MVP (v0.1): Week 5 (✓ Achievable)
- v0.2: Week 9 (✓ Achievable)
- v0.3: Week 13 (✓ Achievable)
- v1.0: Week 15 (✓ Achievable)

## Dependencies & Risks

### Critical Path
```
EPIC-1 (Autonomous Framework)
  ↓
EPIC-2 (Chief of Staff) + EPIC-3 (Operator) [parallel]
  ↓
EPIC-4 (Planner)
  ↓
EPIC-5 (Strategist) + EPIC-6 (Analyst) [parallel]
  ↓
EPIC-7 (Agent Designer)
```

### Key Risks

**Risk 1: Autonomous behaviors more complex than expected**
- Impact: HIGH
- Mitigation: Start with simple scheduled tasks, add complexity incrementally
- Contingency: MVP can work with just daily briefing, add others later

**Risk 2: Learning algorithms don't provide value**
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Start with simple pattern tracking, enhance based on feedback
- Contingency: Can launch without learning, add in v1.1

**Risk 3: User adoption/stickiness**
- Impact: HIGH
- Mitigation: Focus on immediate daily value (Operator first)
- Contingency: Iterate on workflows based on actual usage

**Risk 4: Memory system performance**
- Impact: MEDIUM
- Mitigation: Start with simple file-based storage, optimize later
- Contingency: Can use lightweight database if needed

## Next Steps

1. **Review this backlog** with user (Mike)
2. **Prioritize any adjustments** based on user feedback
3. **Start Sprint 0** (setup and foundation)
4. **Daily standups** (5 min check-ins)
5. **Sprint reviews** at end of each sprint
6. **Retrospectives** - what's working, what's not

---

## Notes

**Agile Principles Applied:**
- ✓ Working software over documentation (but we have docs!)
- ✓ Customer collaboration over contract (user involved throughout)
- ✓ Responding to change over following plan (can adjust sprints)
- ✓ Individuals and interactions (daily collaboration)

**Key Differentiator:**
Remember - this is NOT just BMAD for executives. This is **autonomous agents** that work for you proactively, not just respond when asked. That autonomy is what makes this powerful and is reflected in EPIC-1 being our critical foundation.

Let's build something amazing! 🚀
